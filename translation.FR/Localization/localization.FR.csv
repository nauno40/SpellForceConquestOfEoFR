#Alluvyan_Interrupt_2_3.62577416-83b5-4cd1-a7d8-e576eb0f30ac;A hay cart passes you by, two children playing in the back. "Hey! Not fair, Isabelle!" The boy laughs and flails. His sister sits back down on a familiar looking chest. The one you found under a bridge, a little while ago.\n\nAs the children see you, they wave a friendly greeting, happily on their way to Sevenkeeps.
#Alluvyan_Interrupt_2_3.3f709034-4279-4b99-8091-1a792cfbe900;Wave back.
#Alluvyan_Location_3_2.6203eaff-93ea-4b85-bf6d-13086366c0fb;Somewhat out of place here, you find a beautiful cottage. There are nicely trimmed bushes, artistic flowerbeds, even a shell shaped fountain. Sadly, it is devastated by masses of the undead, and groaning and panting chokes the air.
#Alluvyan_Location_3_2.032b886d-086d-46a6-ab67-c576fc07f50a;Kill those appalling creatures.
#Alluvyan_Location_3_2.8a00c325-b1ff-44bd-93f4-a72db99244bf;Move up silently. Strike out of hiding.
#Alluvyan_Location_3_2.4515e207-a2b3-4f81-9c73-e22c305c58cb;With the undead dealt with, you are free to stroll through the beautiful gardens. Passing the estate, you see the main room adorned with lush rugs, a heavy chandelier and paintings on every wall.
#Alluvyan_Location_3_2.61a74d62-c926-4cb8-9a81-9560a8ee9522;Let's return to lady of the house.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.8504a6db-a551-48c0-abdc-d208cf241f82;Approaching the ruins of a slender elven tower, you see a group of men in Alluvyan colors shouting and pointing at something you cannot see.\n\nAs they spot you, they cry out: "These accursed ghosts keep attacking us! Help us fight them back and you can share the treasure we’ve found here!"
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.e6f672d4-72c8-456c-b5ce-a84f1e0d213e;Attack the undead!
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.ca848776-5063-44ca-b426-799cabb2be90;The ghosts must have had a reason to attack you.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.7e1e4982-f62b-44d5-afcd-116bfebe6506;A melodic voice interrupts you, whispering from the ruined tower.\n\nListening closely, you hear how an elven family hunted by Baron Meldec, centuries ago, sought refuge here. The whispers implore you to leave their resting place in peace, to drive off the men plundering their graves.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.0c6a8309-82c5-430f-8737-594c55382ec0;Attack the graverobbers.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.f5014f62-6ee9-4e39-a5a6-413c08d65595;Grab as much loot as you can and run.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.8ae96f56-4757-476d-98e4-812c8350a265;Attack the undead.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.964d2a33-55bd-4e7d-a51d-ac968921ef7e;You shake off the voice and order your company to hurry to the soldiers’ camp and grab their treasures while they fight the undead.\n\nYou hear angry shouts as you turn and flee, swearing revenge!
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.187e7c21-3ebb-4608-b326-1b015e20f4b6;Fools! Keep watch over your treasures next time.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.f0671392-0212-4663-80f1-928fca5011de;The soldiers thank you, but eye you warily as you approach their camp. A couple stand careful guard of the treasures they have pulled from the tower.\n\nWhen you demand your share, they only reluctantly part with a fraction of it.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_1.e5d91431-5e22-41d7-af50-c06ff9d2b0bf;Pleasure doing business with you.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.2cb9115c-e39a-43f3-b407-f89b6cacc35e;Not far off the path lie dark ruins, crumbling walls reaching from the earth like twisted skeletal fingers. \n\nYou step into the shadows, wondering what might await inside. As if to reply, a cold touch chills you to your bones.\n\nWhen you look around, there is nothing but a dim stairwell down into the cellars that beckons to you.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.51eec567-8c4a-4a2e-9011-65a3ff1c005b;Hello?!
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.f12ce884-79f7-4e2a-8f25-e3fc2db3114e;Comb through the ruins above ground.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.c5f0b733-6f4c-4535-9477-a0406c0e5275;The cold materializes before you as a group of ghostly elven figures dressed in flowing, ornamental robes.\n\nThey sway back and forth, their mouths open in silent song.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.d6dd9edc-4e73-474d-82bd-a4b7bc3f0c26;Greet them.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.32d971e9-0a9e-4136-b2d1-c1c44c6524aa;Banish them before they cast some enchantment.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.0d0d319e-660b-4acf-a171-6b923f0e535a;You must be Berenil’s ghost! IWe mean you no harm.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.fcb77f3c-5a18-48cf-a2f6-e449ac4b0917;Searching the ruins, you conclude the castle was violently destroyed. There are claw marks on the walls and floor to suggest it was literally torn apart by its assailants.\n\nYou collect what you can find of use but suddenly notice the intensifying cold again.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.1a2ec2a4-1f97-474f-8951-008bef84a792;Be prepared for a fight.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.ced17ea7-2f78-49f2-acf0-b3af2eb2697c;Wait what happens.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.9ee04894-79ee-41c1-af8d-59cf153cc9e7;The ghosts withdraw a short distance, but silently cry out once more.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.d8385e31-8db9-4267-b34d-0ad43efce187;They are more afraid of us than we of them.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.7f1b88a5-9841-435d-8695-79b81eae6fef;The tallest ghost floats forwards, extending her arms with her palms raised.\n\n"Listen, mortal! My name is Berenil. I was once leader of Dun Mael. Baron Meldec, our neighbor, was envious of the blessings Tiara bestowed upon us. He demanded I wed him. I tried to reason with him, offering Tiara’s blessing instead."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.0007ef91-9663-4bc5-9447-7f6d67e0308f;And then?
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.70c43600-8924-4f37-b44c-d58c2e5c13ec;"We were invited to his castle to enact our ritual dance, but Tiara’s blessing would not come. In his greed, Meldec made a pact with Nor, a renegade Guardian, to grant him the power to bind me to him forever.\n\nI resisted his sorcery, by Tiara’s grace, but he imprisoned us, swearing to sacrifice us to Nor to obtain our power. Blinded by hatred, he assumed some spell was at work."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.5992d733-4c96-4f8d-a3fd-f2420b7ddaf6;Nor may have poisoned him with words. What then?
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.97c7bbf8-49a0-4f40-a171-c01f5a782d79;"I knew my people would come for me. Much blood would be shed. I could not bear that burden, but nor could I let our souls be sacrificed. My sisters and I made a pact. We took each other’s lives before the Black Baron could."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.dd34b470-492a-4ab6-8016-b73f340c1535;You... you killed yourselves?!
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.f0d6d8c5-c270-4548-b6d4-200e73d4834e;"It was our only choice. Had he sacrificed us, his powers would have become far greater. Either way, my people would have suffered his wrath."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.e8616c52-81db-41d5-9d68-7293d830c5bc;I applaud your heroic sacrifice.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.47ed36a2-4ab6-498b-b6f7-2abf4b19d018;Tiara frowns on taking your own lives!
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.a3170af1-060f-4971-b8cb-2b2983f82a66;But... there are no elves in these hills anymore...
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.9f4b77a3-d31f-4ff2-ba40-c8f66e2292c5;"It is no different than dying in battle for the right cause." The ghost’s face becomes pained and sorrowful. "But a cruel twist of fate binds us here regardless."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.4ee6cd57-c92d-4fa6-8db5-9ef41fd6d39b;What happened?
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.1ed6bef3-6c5f-43bb-893d-475e98cf31fa;"Our sacrifice was in vain. Meldec entered his pact with Nor promising the dark Guardian our souls on his own blood. With us dead, he feared Nor would take him.\n\nRather than face this, in panic he took his children to Nor’s shrine. His kin. His blood. He gave them to Nor to save himself."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.651e807e-3800-4ca2-9bc7-25d3f370619e;Such depravity!
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.7a25173a-0ff0-4c8a-9570-c79f8664c74e;He tricked Nor, then? Interesting.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.d866dc90-d04b-49b1-b2ee-43a52eb4e5d0;"Indeed. But in denying ourselves as sacrifice, we doomed those innocents to death. We cannot rest until this foul deed has been avenged!"
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.341dd403-069b-4138-a165-77026234ffaa;Does Meldec live too?
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.e7ff6ecb-6ee2-43cd-af51-223f61ec6c49;"His pact left him trapped between life and death. Hidden from Hirin’s eyes he fell into insanity. No doubt, his sins weighed heavily on him.\n\nOver time, he turned his troops to undeath and attacked Dun Mael, destroying it utterly. In return, our people raised the very forests around this place to obliterate it.\n\nEver since, he sits and broods in the shrine to his renegade Guardian. Go there. End this once and for all."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.a34a1baa-21b0-4a73-bb11-eb2abe07581e;I will take care of it.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.25bc0fad-f076-4e6f-b673-13692abe88f0;I will be interested to hear his side of things.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.3c5b1fbc-3602-403e-9d16-5a1adaeab45d;Think of all the knowledge he must have learned...
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.50def235-9a06-4cb9-91a0-ab6d6e9ac32b;"This is folly! He paid a great price for his power. So may you!"
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.1181227c-128f-48ad-bc36-87565821c98e;We shall see...
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.9b48607f-3aa1-4ff3-bda6-d2803d22344d;The ghostly figures begin to fade with a sigh on the wind. But Berenil stays for one moment longer, staring at you coldly.\n\n"We put all our hope in you, mortal. I pray to Tiara you will not fail us."
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.31e378a7-ef09-4bf0-9b69-ef3b273451d9;I will try my best.
#Ghosthills_ruin_2.0552ac33-7b1f-4095-b4b4-c46664abebb3;Let's see.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.e3ee3340-656b-422f-ab43-f56d6e99211e;You can see a swarm of undead and phantoms moving in the dark shadows of the keep.\n\nThe dark knight's hollow voice rings out: "So, what do you want, mortal?". He stands there motionlessly, awaiting your reply.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.b04e2f57-68bd-42e3-86ca-6e9ee8b935cd;You must be Meldec. Prepare to meet your final fate!
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.0a70df22-5be8-40fc-82a6-c41d868c9307;Talk to Meldec.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.fa13a3fb-67bd-4e96-b70b-c0144657f00d;The black baron laughs mirthlessly. "If you seek to gain the renegade god's secret knowledge, I can teach you the art of creating undead and ruling over them.\n\nWhat are you willing to give in return? Nor always expects a sacrifice."
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.90d867f8-bcd8-4309-9524-83603e4654b9;"Very well, give me your power and you shall receive my master's lore."
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.5afce34c-9f72-4d50-87c5-cf9abbb6ca61;A small price to pay.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.20723e86-1efc-440a-89bd-36309e4d4d99;"It starts and ends in blood. Nor will decide whose blood from those here shall be spilled.Then you shall get your reward. Know that there is more...much more to gain. Knowledge and power are the dark lord's gifts."
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.d7f4a58e-8e58-43ab-a9e9-c8ba07af8955;I hope it's worth it.
#Ghosthills_Ruin_3.92663da5-308c-4598-aeff-81727bc127aa;As the Black Baron falls, the ghosts of Berenil and her priestesses appear.\n\n"You have done a great service to Tiara, and the world, by vanquishing this evil. Now we will finally know peace. May Tiara’s blessing be with you, always. Your noble deed shall resonate across all creation.\n\nTake this accursed ground. With time, may your virtue cleanse it of its evil."

He had thrown many such a party, where every guest was asked to perform for the others. Artful or silly, joyous or dramatic, each performance was cheered on by the crowd. Except one, at this celebration. A local baron, an evil man and a practitioner of the dark arts, used his performance to put a curse on the entire room! The laughter and cheering that had made the nobleman so much more popular than the baron would never cease. Some say, you can still hear it today, from the ruins of his manor. Some say, if you ever go there, you will foever be a guest to their merriment."

More likely, it was not made by any humanoid.\n\nYou follow the large, rounded tunnel deep into the earth until it branches different ways. To the left, a rough path trodden by hundreds of feet. To the right, a glint of daylight.

Or we’ll make you!” one of the human shouts.\n\nAngered by your intervention, the crowd is getting more and more riled up.

But I am not taking on commissions anymore, I am afraid.\n\nYou see, my eyes aren't what they used to be and mixing ingredients is a fickle craft. Wouldn't want to blow up the shop, ey?

A very burly, heavy man appears with guards in tow, breathing hard. "Have you… Have you seen her?

#To save a nephew.89263a0a-7d3f-4891-8a55-bead153f0c5e;We should prepare some more before entering.
#To save a nephew.326dc1eb-84ff-43c1-b933-f1c625ce3267;You are swallowed up in the dark of the cave quite quickly but a little deeper inside you see light reflecting off the wall of a bend, bobbing up and down as if something is floating just around the corner.
#To save a nephew.b5f3b4c0-eab6-4891-9388-8aaa271e64d2;Tarv said to follow the lights.
#To save a nephew.33e83755-a2a3-48c6-823c-de65330dde0a;Don’t follow the lights. Explore other ways.
#To save a nephew.c7f230b5-0ac3-4e80-b7df-48427ca7a53c;Rounding the corner, you find yourselves in a glistening cave.\n\nLarge stalagmites grow from the ground, many see-through like crystal. Others are overgrown with ivy, moss or mushrooms. Some of the walls overflow with greenery as well. The light is being created by some of the rocks, giving everything a dim and shifting blue sheen.\n\nYou see the same light emanating down another, short tunnel on the other side of the chamber.
#To save a nephew.8097b858-9435-4cba-8599-4d90637c7017;Without any further warning, Lore uncorks one of his blasting devices and lobs it into the middle of the nest.\n\nThe chamber erupts. Beetle bits fly everywhere as stalagmites explode and rock shudders, collapsing large parts of the ceiling. The bugs scream as that or the fire kills them. It takes nought but a few moments.\n\nThen the chamber lies still once again, barely passable but now - at least - pest-free.
#To save a nephew.d370c251-51aa-4789-9d5f-08c4f0a58410;Eventually, you happen upon yet another beautiful cave of glowing and sparkling rocks. Here, you think you hear a faint cry for help coming from below. One of the tunnels leads gently downwards until it comes to a room with a large cage in the middle of it. Inside, a young dwarf with glasses and red clothes is pressed against the bars, reaching for a mechanism on the wall just beyond his touch.\n\n"I'd lost hope!" he yelps as he sees you. "Until I heard you coming from upstairs. Quick! Press that button!"
#To save a nephew.798d5bf9-d1d9-43b8-9b23-d0c72e6462e7;How did you get into this conundrum?
#To save a nephew.6bfd110f-bdaa-4727-a0f7-ae2ca07c92c3;As you enter the chamber, there is a faint ‘click’ as one of your soldiers takes a step.\n\nFrom the tunnel behind the cage, lava begins to roll down onto the floor and towards the cage. In moments it will flood the room. The dwarf looks at it and screams.\n\n“No! No, no, no, no, no!” he shouts. “Help me!”
#To save a nephew.dc1e7790-e6bf-4a4c-b886-e6765882de7a;There is nothing we can do.
#To save a nephew.83f60a03-6151-4a66-bf74-b0755ec3a55f;Stay still! I will put up a barrier.
#To save a nephew.497982b8-9880-43cf-b509-07ac363d4139;I can deviate the lava's path.
#To save a nephew.6f7fa71f-a928-4d71-ac15-4a3fa5ad50f9;You expect to hear screams, not just from the dwarf but your own people too. But after a second… nothing. After another second… Still nothing.\n\nCarefully looking around, you see lava everywhere, now flooding out of the cage and back into the chamber. You see smoke rising from it. But there’s no heat. No searing pain. Inside the cage, the dwarf looks confused, carefully putting a hand into the sea of lava and waving it around.\n\n“Huh,” he says in surprise. It must be some illusionary magic.
#To save a nephew.7c7b16f3-f68f-4f98-8528-e92d75ca53de;As quickly as you are able, you throw up a magical shield that reaches the far side of the cage just before the lava does. A golden red tide crashes against the magical force and you expect rock and magma to bounce off it, scorching the walls.\n\nInstead, they are left completely unmarked. When the lava stops flowing, the dwarf in the cage is looking at it curiously.\n\n"It's not hot!" he calls out. "In fact it's not anything."
#To save a nephew.82e7314b-ccb8-441c-9a60-dac5fb92c7b5;The lava must be some kind of illusion.
#To save a nephew.1966869b-a990-44fd-85a8-83077bee6cf6;You cast a small cantrip to try to force the lava away from its path, at least to spare the dwarf a gruesome death, even if he must continue to be trapped in the cage.\n\nBut the magical burst of energy that stretches out from your hand has no effect.
#To save a nephew.af7a6914-662d-4e06-bb07-1dd19dac6294;What?!
#To save a nephew.67edafac-abfe-47ae-b0d8-77c38859f5f4;What a pointless trap!
#To save a nephew.aa1680c2-bf3a-43da-b7f1-e9b539b3e838;The mechanism on the wall slips into place very easily and some hidden gears pull the cage back up towards the ceiling. The dwarf cries with relief.\n\n“Many thanks, grand mage! This has been far too much adventure for me. I must return to my uncle post haste. Don’t hesitate to visit us. Again, thank you!”
#To save a nephew.955346fb-bb97-40d9-bfca-594b2c484202;Maybe tell your uncle to rethink his defenses.
#To save a nephew.01e8871f-d1d1-4093-a83e-f5d3ca12244e;“My uncle sent me here to retrieve some alchemical components! Apparently he trapped the cave so no one else could deplete his stash and forgot to tell me! Please! Get me out of here!”\n\nHe is exhausted, but seems honest enough.

Walked right past our windows last night!"

#Neighbours.b5ec6024-0d57-4817-94d6-e0f5d99f0e52;The woman sighs.\n\n"Well, usually, we would call on the militia, but they rarely come.

I mean the master here... Maybe he would know what to do against the nightwalkers? The village is in despair."

A little further on, it opens into a much wider cave. Crystals sparkle along a passage leading one way, another wall is made up of spiked rocks. Opposite, there is more moss, and lush vines that crawl up the wall. Somewhere in the same direction, a light trickle of water comes into the room as a stream.
#Prophecy Cave.8400e4b1-9a2b-40b7-bdba-851f4372293b;Those crystals look enticing.
#Prophecy Cave.27bdb04e-188d-4ae1-abad-3f4490b8cea2;Those are not natural spikes, are they?
#Prophecy Cave.261571fe-dc3e-43b8-977a-d3caee4211a6;The vines could be sturdy enough to climb.
#Prophecy Cave.863b00e5-7b1a-46b6-b959-7a7312788508;You are making your way towards the crystals, the sharp and jagged wall suddenly shifts and begins moving forward with alarming sounds and speed. A quick calculation tells you it will reach you before you reach the crystals.
#Prophecy Cave.fc2b9e13-abb9-4f53-9f87-4c92b242c969;Quickly, through the vines!

#Prophecy Cave.db01a624-55b8-47c4-b05d-36ea922cc6ed;Taking a much closer look at the spiked wall, you realize that they are made up of bones and swords, crushed and wedged in between the stones. They protrude like needle points, threatening to slice anyone open who comes close enough.
#Prophecy Cave.072ff938-12b3-4a81-b18e-7cf4768f298a;As you inspect the vines and the way up the wall, you are surprised to feel a cold wind against your face. There is no wall! Behind the vines is another passage!

#Prophecy Cave.ead45252-fc19-4251-940e-4ee4cbfced3c;The wall shunts you all across the room and into the vines. Expecting your troops to be crushed to death, you are surprised when you find yourself shoved into another stunning cave - worse for wear, but certainly alive. This cavern is an oasis, bathed in the warmth and light of the sun coming in from a hole in the high, domed ceiling. You even find Lenya growing in the diffused light.

The fields and hills lie still and quiet before you, but as you look around, you blink. Suddenly, where there was certainly nothing before, the ruin of a long forgotten castle has appeared.\n\nFrom the highest tower, you hear loud sobbing and the occasional morose cry. Most of the entrances lie desolate before you.

#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.30e520e8-d456-47e5-8f30-0e663c4d50f8;The sobbing continues, as if you have not been heard.

#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.cd5fa347-4124-431e-bb6d-29f2af6b1a7d;You scout the area around the tower, finding two possible entrances.\n\nThere are some loose stone-slabs in the base wall. With a great feat of strength, you might be able to remove them.\n\nThere is also a window you could reach by climbing the vines that creep up the tower.

A cold wind brushes past you.
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.b00eb4eb-ac6c-4280-adcd-b8ea3916d01a;Let's make our way up.
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.ffe51843-d211-464d-aafc-0ab11616ae8b;Finding a good foothold on the crumbling stone proves difficult, and clasping onto the vines is exhausting. Eventually, you reach the lowest window, and inside find a winding staircase covered in decaying leaves.

Beyond, you hear the cries and sobs again, now much louder.
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.6f8037ca-12d4-4978-b060-280fd11ea269;Hello?!
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.704e3f0f-f6df-4069-83c7-ea12220b029e;The sobbing suddenly stops. A gentle, male voice passes through the door.\n\n"Who are you? Please tell me you're here to free us! You just need to open the door! But... be careful of my father. He's temparemental in his old age."\n\nJust as those words are spoken, the pile of skulls emits a ghostly wail.\n\n"You will not harm them!"

#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.c553a125-931e-4489-b60d-fc7f02224602;As soon as your troops break down the door, a ghostly wail rises up around you, and the dust twists and turns across the floor.\n\n"You will not harm them! Get out. Get out!"\n\nThe skulls on the floor begin to emit a dull, pale light. Amplifiers, you realise too late! Making the spirits stronger.

#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.e88e9f87-9f37-4ecc-94d9-649e1693cf35;No sooner have you fought your way into the room do you become aware of the skeleton sat up in the large double bed, clasping the hand of another that lies quiet and dormant next to it. Both are dressed in withered noble's clothes, and other than a thick layer of dust, and cobwebs hanging in every corner, the room they inhabit looks well lived in.\n\n"You did it!" A gentle voice floats from the gap between the sitting skeleton's teeth. "Thank you! He's been driving me mad for years!"
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.51740589-a739-4453-9a81-0b82115693a6;Are you a prisoner here?
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.f53524ed-523a-48ea-9402-cff9cf19c7d6;There is a long pause before the voice floats through the room again.\n\n"Kind of." He sounds unsure. "This is my father's keep. He hid us here. The people... they had problems with... us." The skeleton's head tilts with a loud click towards the skeleton whose hand it holds. "He only wanted to protect us, but the fool's vows trapped us here. When my love passed away, I stayed behind to stop my father causing chaos. Thankfully it is over now. It was going quite poorly!"
#Gossip Mongers Highmark Human Tavern 1_2.fe53aecc-1316-4cc1-9d12-dd1a33abe8d8;With your pockets full of the small treasures you find scattered across the room, you leave.

They are made to last centuries and never dull their edge!"\n\nHe pauses a moment, as if waiting for a reaction."These weapons were forged a fortnight ago. And now look at them! Nothing but junk!" He spits and knocks them from the table angrily. The brittle metal shatters into pieces on the floor.\n\n"This is a curse!” Kelgrun foams, his face red with anger. “A powerful one, cast by no mere witch or wizard. This… this comes from the magistrate and his cronies!"

We thus find ourselves unable to confirm the accusations leveled against them and unable to commence with a fair trial.\n\nI was hoping you could act as a go-between, seeing as you have served the Academy in the past.

#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 4.490ed6f6-4875-41d6-9dfe-5695d847b6b6;Close the alcove with a large stone.

#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 6.bf76dc18-6f01-4a71-8604-e7fb6acb58f7;As you wander the Windwall Mountains, a sudden avalanche crashes down next to you. It barely passes your troops, ripping stones into the deep and uncovering a cave entrance. From within, you can hear a hungry and dangerous growl.
#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 6.86eafafd-2700-49bf-816f-8bdde421f99b;Snow leopards! Defend yourselves!
#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 6.7d09effb-168d-4e47-9c9b-d2585bcbc508;Hide behind those boulders!
#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 6.3fbd295d-1830-4e91-88bc-75ef2a2aca43;A small pack of snow leopards jump forth from the cave and takes off into the mountains. They must have been trapped in there for some time. \n\nWith them gone, you take a moment to inspect the cave they sprang from. Among the chewed remains of at least two dwarves, you find some coins and riches. What a sad fate to be trapped with hungry snow leopards.
#Windwall Mountains Rockslide 6.0ed1b60e-3eb9-4304-ae68-797672b73e92;We better leave, or we'll meet the same fate.

#Dwarf City Entrance.e8c8271d-cf7c-4601-bdac-b6413b0cbb34;You march up to the iron gate leading to the dwarven tunnels. No guards stand on the outside, but on the other side you see well armored dwarves watching you closely.

#Dwarf City Entrance.7449ddf0-0a1a-4eea-bc5a-869921c57a6c;Having broken through the gate, you hear the sound of a horn echo through the tunnels. It seems the dwarves sent scouts back into the mines and they are mobilizing against you!

#Dwarf City Entrance.d620a4b5-d2f9-450a-be4b-6657934ea588;We merely wish to talk.

#Dwarf City Entrance.8e487ff4-82d0-4ffa-8548-5acdc172e1be;The old dwarf shrugs and defiantly replies: "Threaten me all you want. It won't help you find the truth. I have been willing to reason with you but, if this continues, you leave me no choice but to fight!"

#Dwarf City Entrance.6ea3e4fe-4a50-478b-b724-64b9093d4d8b;Magistrate Reinhardt is plotting against you.
#Dwarf City Entrance.f9b3d3dd-2946-4554-81e8-b96007286ffd;There is a pause and you hear urgent murmurs from behind the gate. Then a voice rings out: "Why should we trust you? The magistrate might have sent you as yet another foul trick. They poisoned our guild master, you know?"
#Dwarf City Entrance.f2451a20-0f0d-4f6c-86de-ba9c0b1857a0;Believe me, I have no sympathy for the magistrate.

#Dwarf City Entrance.f68699f6-97ec-447f-b6b5-cfaf78cd6cc4;Magistrate Reinhardt accuses you of foul play.
#Dwarf City Entrance.33ac5571-547a-4cfa-bd72-8dec35ef21b6;We came to warn you. The magistrate plots your downfall.
#Dwarf City Entrance.045f3b7d-0730-4ca4-9a08-6c940f518620;We wish to mediate this divide peacefully.
#Dwarf City Entrance.76ababb6-7c97-4b6c-ba5e-5a6208c289fa;Your emissary tried to recruit me. I was not convinced.
#Dwarf City Entrance.0886daaf-ba06-4c01-9fc2-e0acc178b8dc;I will be the one asking the questions here.
#Dwarf City Entrance.4405038a-5ce3-42fb-b1c3-28293c012033;The dwarf's face clouds over with anger.\n\n"The Magistrate accused us of knowingly selling tarnished weapons. He has sullied our reputation and used his lies as an excuse to banish us from the city. We have suffered a grave injustice and now you come to my doorstep with this?! I will not be insulted in my own hall!"
#Dwarf City Entrance.3674d3b9-6efc-4ce2-ac11-b97b19777739;I apologize. So you think the Magistrate wronged you?
#Dwarf City Entrance.289fbc37-22ab-4925-9a4e-8e3536495971;I will take you to the Magistrate now.
#Dwarf City Entrance.9e471832-5688-4de4-b49a-fefba2e1dcf1;Then lets get to the bottom of this, shall we?
#Dwarf City Entrance.639639f7-19cc-4293-91c9-452b0ad98386;The dwarf nods slowly.\n\n"Yes. I fell for his deceit when he accused the elves of stealing the Academy's books and poisoning our guild master.\n\nBut now I see that the Magistrate has been plotting to rid himself of all competition within the Council. The tarnished adamantinum was just a happy accident he has used to sow further discord."
#Dwarf City Entrance.a587ced0-eda0-45c8-bff5-a31b33071b2e;So he isn't behind the weapons breaking?
#Dwarf City Entrance.1ce5e499-bd1a-4228-a33e-e9ec20b2e0d0;"The weapons were forged by the best craftsmen in Windholme - as usual. Of late, we have discovered that something is affecting the metal. It has become tarnished, turning brittle and weak after a while. We have no explanation yet for the root cause. \n\nBut for once, the Academy bears no blame. We told Master Reinhardt about it but he accused us of deceiving the Council. We had no choice but to leave before he turned the whole city against us."
#Dwarf City Entrance.5c4da552-a05c-4125-8875-ec008cdb7b4d;So Master Reinhardt knew and used me?
#Dwarf City Entrance.9133cc38-f3b1-4bb3-b120-9c3ea4b2ccea;He has tried to trick me into persuing you.
#Dwarf City Entrance.fe55db9e-3ae5-4eaf-a729-28452193e8d7;Do you have any proof for your words?
#Dwarf City Entrance.1f085b8a-d5b9-4c7c-b64d-0d6585743644;You still sold the useless weapons. That is negligence!
#Dwarf City Entrance.6eca9c33-83cf-4a78-949d-a9d0be6055f5;Bring it on!
#Dwarf City Entrance.19cc4919-1150-4570-aa18-c72c2710a22e;Tell me your tale then. Not that I believe you.
#Dwarf City Entrance.08a25f7f-3c9e-4fcf-a36c-bd75254e3023;Then tell me truth about the adamantinum weapons.
#Dwarf City Entrance.da5cf733-318b-404f-af77-b056b5fe6590;"I have had enough of this! I won't stand here and suffer any more insults!" the old dwarf roars angrily. \n\nBefore you can react, he steps up to the stone wall behind him and melts into it. All around you, you hear the clatter of iron-shod boots.
#Dwarf City Entrance.5c9057fb-6884-45c3-b220-be01285d7ebb;To arms!
#Dwarf City Entrance.81de1f4b-3794-4980-9f4c-3a15f02a2156;"I have a letter…" His voice trails off and you can hear a horn sounding from the corridor leading to the chamber.\n\n"We are under attack!” he shouts after a moment. “Argh! The magistrate and his forces have entered our tunnels. You have betrayed us!"\n\nThe dwarf runs to the stone wall and seems to melt into it, disappearing.
#Dwarf City Entrance.bd78344e-5f3c-4e5b-b8f8-96dd64d4d58c;No! We have nothing to do with this!
#Dwarf City Entrance.b65452ae-a8e2-4be1-99b6-a994d8b49394;No! The magistrate has deceived us as well!
#Dwarf City Entrance.0789f19e-b5f4-41a7-8bab-67732016db55;You leave the chamber and come upon a great hall, where Maednir and his dwarves are already facing a small army of the City Watch. You can spot Magistrate Reinhardt behind the lines.\n\n"Ah." He nods. "I see you have come in time for the finale. Thank you for showing us the way in and keeping the dwarves occupied. Now, if you just help us settle this affair, the greatest library in all Fiara will be at your disposal. And I’m sure the Sevenkeeps Council will show their gratitude as well."
#Dwarf City Entrance.89d3c133-2bd7-454c-841b-9c6b1ee9c72f;Side with the dwarves.
#Dwarf City Entrance.1b422b0b-0961-407a-a614-11becaf095bd;Side with Reinhardt.
#Dwarf City Entrance.badb8ec2-e0fa-4949-9841-ef69301595e1;Your sacrifice was not in vain.\n\nYou bought the dwarves time to rally, allowing them to fight back against the magistrate’s forces. Reinhardt himself, however, escapes to Sevenkeeps and the gates to the dwarven realm remains locked as the Council finds itself at an impasse.
#Dwarf City Entrance.ff1ebcaa-0a2e-4b40-a022-9c722b6ddb20;Magistrate Reinhardt lies dead at your feet but the dwarves catch one of his apprentices, who testifies to his plans to take over the Academy and rule the Council. He even wanted to bewitch the young king so he could control the child and rule in his stead.\n\nYour bravery has not only saved the dwarves, but all of Sevenkeeps from the magistrate’s rule, preventing the Highmark from sinking into civil war. The dwarves are generous and grateful.
#Dwarf City Entrance.541d24e5-9307-415b-b21d-5d45bb0ab4c5;Now there shall be peace again.
#Dwarf City Entrance.0f132287-f445-4bd2-bd05-9f6efff81f20;You are overrun by the defending dwarves, who pour onto the field of battle to drive Reinhardt and his forces back too.\n\nThe magistrate is furious, berating you for your weakness. Sevenkeeps settles into an uneasy truce as the dwarves keep the gates to their realm locked.
#Dwarf City Entrance.661d61f1-9898-4155-9d61-3a0622348c32;Your attack overwhelms Maednir and his forces. Magistrate Reinhardt's men chase the remaining dwarves deep into their tunnels.\n\nReinhardt congratulates you on your victory and the Royal Academy’s library opens its doors to you. You have become a hero to the humans of Sevenkeeps.
#Dwarf City Entrance.330a2290-140a-4028-b10b-4472d51ea2a1;Finally a proper reward for my troubles.

On the binding, you also find a spidery pattern of barely legible words, right where some of those pages would have been.

They seem to point somewhere a bit further away from the tower.\n\nSurely, this was meant for you to find. Perhaps some of the grimoire’s missing pages are hidden at the locations the instructions point to.

#Lytra Adventure 1.17e7357d-ee5f-47d0-8a44-b3f149e17691;Even from afar you can clearly make out the New Purity's white banners. They are marching on a village. Lytra's hand instinctively reaches for her weapon as she stands in her saddle to get a better view.\n\n"They will round up everyone in that village, young or old. They will torture each and every one of them until they find someone with magic to... 'cleanse'. We must stop them. I can't stand idly by and watch them torture innocents!"
#Lytra Hiring.584878d7-2304-4a5e-b783-a1dfd9ff7789;The what? Why would they want me?
#Lytra Hiring.83ca3034-ecd9-4f89-a341-f55d133a606e;A shadow washes over her face and she shifts uncomfortably.\n\n"I... I served the Purity myself. My father sent me to them, telling me they were servants of Aonir, concerned with the fate of the common people, dedicated to the Light. With each passing day, I realised their ways are far from righteous. I cannot bear to witness that. They must be stopped."
#Lytra Hiring.77f45c58-f6b1-4f67-b467-5986846075fb;And how do you intend to do this?
#Lytra Hiring.10ce0b82-a7bb-4a41-88e1-bbe7ab7a8b66;What do they want with me?
#Lytra Hiring.e2f95a68-f791-47dd-a120-2fa702cac850;She glances towards your tower and suppresses a shudder.\n\n"They claim practising magic is usurping the Guardians' power. An affront to the Allfather Aonir that leads him and his Guardians to abandon us. They see it as their duty to cleanse anyone practicing magic from their impure desires. Few survive this ordeal."
#Lytra Hiring.f1b0a43c-4e00-41a4-a235-ccaf9844acaf;So how do we stop them?
#Lytra Hiring.b5f79316-785c-4562-9c47-1b43f40beb96;First I want to know your connection to the Purity.

#Lytra Adventure 1_2.b2cc9a44-3888-413c-9023-1c01f50e71f3;As Lytra predicted, the Purity followers are already busy rounding up villagers in the market square. One of their leaders preaches about Aonir and how he will not return as long as Eo remains tainted by the practice of magic. The villagers listen in fear, crying and begging for mercy.
#Lytra Adventure 1_2.e8e933ee-e213-4a04-9fd8-b6520b298388;Storm the village.
#Lytra Adventure 1_2.75ab16aa-24de-4a48-b84d-85db295f743e;Let's try to talk to their leader.

#Lytra Adventure 1_2.3dc5bd3f-d2b9-47fa-b53a-97253bffbe60;The townsfolk flee into their homes during the fight and only reemerge when it has died down.\n\n"Thank you for defending us. We don't have any arcanists here, just a wise woman. The Purity would have killed her, though she never harmed a soul. Let us thank you with this humble gift."\n\nYou are handed a pouch filled with fragrant herbs and other ingredients.
#Lytra Adventure 1_2.b89df22e-85f7-4029-ad49-19ce3c611ee8;We shall rain vengeance on these fanatics!
#Lytra Adventure 1_2.2a57b7a6-a078-45f7-a04d-074d0b235cd0;Thank you. I hope you will be safe now.
#Lytra Adventure 1_2.a7dfdc13-2cf7-4587-8bd7-f9ee3a0ec5aa;All eyes turn on you. The leader's face shifts from surprise to burning hatred.\n\n"You wield your blasphemous magic openly, sorcerer! You will be cleansed! Neither word nor coin will lead us astray from the path of righteousness!"\n\nHe signals his troops to attack.

She bows stiffly, waiting for your eyes to meet before posing her request.\n\n"When I led the Purity into the Misty Coast, we caught a shaman of the Stonebuilder orc clan. I have had word he is still alive - imprisoned in one of the Purity's strongholds. I have to save him, if I can."\n\nYou can see it pains her to be responsible for the shaman's fate. Not everyone would think of an orc this way.
#Lytra Adventure 2.170ce146-be7d-4958-8d56-63f0cfc67fe1;Do what you must.

#Lytra Adventure 2_2.a9276b4e-8557-4862-8ac4-c5949518738c;The Purity has taken refuge in an old watchtower. An orc is being held in a kennel at the front of the tower, guarded by a few soldiers. He looks weak and exhausted, his skin blistered from multiple brands.\n\n"That is the shaman," Lytra says. "To think I led these soldiers in our assault on the clan's village..."
#Lytra Adventure 2.dbdf53a9-f2bb-417c-b082-2409b9683e88;"I am uncertain. The tribe did supposedly posses knowledge of an old, orcish artifact. Zarach's Banner, I think it was called. Maybe they want that, for some reason."
#Lytra Adventure 2.29531364-6530-4ae0-9bf3-df1bf57441fb;All the more reason to stop them.
#Lytra Adventure 2.c0258e54-2f21-4e5d-a38a-d356348c5788;I doubt they have the banner, but still worth investigating.
#Lytra Adventure 2.5d9295dd-0cfa-400f-b14b-3239638719fa;"I care that the shaman and his village suffer because of me. I must right the wrong I contributed to. Please, let me absolve myself of this."

#Lytra Adventure 2_2.d32713ad-6330-48fa-93c9-beed531c8917;Lytra rides towards the guarded tower and hails the white-clad soldiers, bellowing orders. They looked confused but open the prisoner's cage. With an air of authority wrapped around her like a cloak, Lytra leads the prisoner away. None of the soldiers dare stop her.\n\nQuickly returning to you, she reports: "News of my desertion hasn't reached them yet. They think I am delivering the prisoner to the Westguard. Quickly now, let's be away before they realize their folly."
#Lytra Adventure 2_2.584d7e27-d8e8-46e4-9156-a8dfc95e6f67;That went... very well!
#Lytra Adventure 2_2.5a7fc86c-6c04-4996-b09e-aa4507af3ad3;The orc seems to recognize his savior. Shaking from exhaustion, he looks at Lytra with a mixture of disgust and anger.\n\n"I know you. You are with the whitecloaks. Why help me now?"

#Lytra Adventure 2_2.dc568dff-f144-4fa2-bd06-132ff188a4dc;Lytra carefully steps forward.\n\n"I wronged you. I know that. But I no longer follow the Purity and want to fix my past mistakes. I am truly sorry for the harm I caused you and your clan."\n\nThe shaman remains silent for a while before replying: "Zarach teaches that the fire of our actions burns away guilt. If you wish for that, come to my village soon. You must see something."
#Lytra Adventure 2_2.e73b931d-3a66-4d1c-955d-fd12f9ea795e;We will be there.

#Lytra Adventure 2_3.90ed5c15-eac4-4f78-b08c-00ccd6f9e990;The orcish village is a scene of desolation. Many dwellings have been destroyed. Everywhere are large mounds of ash and charcoal. Pyres, erected and already burned out. Amid it all, the shaman stands as part of a small group, many of them wounded and scarred, most staring at you in fear and hatred.\n\n"Here," the shaman says harshly, sweeping an arm across the scene. "This is what happened when I was caught by you and the whitecloaks. Your father's soldiers slaughtered my clan without mercy. Your regret will bring none of them back."
#Lytra Adventure 2_3.d982a50f-3b9e-4ced-a0e7-b5e77b83fbc6;My father would never do something like this!

#Lytra Adventure 2_3.f6e3e0df-0da6-4758-9c25-36067dc56d20;The shaman keeps his face stoic. "You know in your heart I speak the truth. Your father has always hated us, coveted our lands. He used the Purity to weaken the village so that he could strike. Our dead are witness to his cruelty!"\n\nLytra trembles. "You don't know he ordered this slaughter. I am sorry for your loss, really, but there is no proof here he was involved. I will get to the bottom of this, mark my word. Whoever it was shall be punished."
#Lytra Adventure 2_3.5713d218-4ed2-434e-bb3a-4735de2ff9c3;The shaman laughs bitterly: "Child, your father has always hated us and coveted our lands. He used the Purity to weaken our clan then struck when he saw the chance. Greed drove him to this."\n\nLytra trembles. In a low voice, she replies: "He has lied to me my whole life. He used me to further his ambitions and gave me to the Purity as a pawn in his schemes."\n\nShe holds her hand to her heart. "I swear he will pay for this. Justice will be served!"
#Lytra Adventure 2_3.b4d3a080-791a-4cca-beb8-1db6b0fe595a;I am sorry for your losses.

#Lytra Adventure 3.6f18fff7-17a1-4d4f-994c-6ae0a8f5322d;Lytra stands before you, her face determined and her voice steely.\n\n"I have thought about what the shaman said. I know in my heart he spoke the truth. My father deceived me all my life, abusing me to further his own ambition. Whatever his goals are, he and the Purity must be stopped once and for all. I must leave for the Westguard and put an end to my father's reign."
#Lytra Adventure 3.faca8eca-4af2-460b-a7e6-573d833487e4;You want to wage war on the Westguard?
#Lytra Adventure 3.523c76e1-adac-4bdf-805f-92c714521eff;She nods grimly.\n\n"Yes. I think... it is the only way. My father cannot be allowed to continue his rule. We must march against the Westguard and the New Purity's strongholds."
#Lytra Adventure 3.a2b6beaa-fca9-4aec-9aa5-e7ecc15d48e8;Are you sure? He is still your father.

He has certainly brought a respectable force with him. There are guards outside, at the ready, and more waiting nearby.\n\nHe sits at a table in the middle of the room, his sword lying in front of him. His dark look speaks of both irritation and disappointment. Lytra's shoulders sag slightly at the sight of the man in plate armor.\n\n"I thought I taught you better, Lytra. Stand straight and speak fast. Why have you betrayed me?"

Most patrons are hidden under wide brimmed hoods or armed to the teeth.\n\nOne table holds the whole room's attention. Someone is watching the man opposite them mix three cups, a pile of gold and a leather pouch next to them. When the mixing stops, the whole room leans closer. The player's hand hovers over the cups, stopping atop the left one. The dealer's eye twitches. The player grins savagely as they lift the cup, but there is nothing underneath. They scream angrily, throwing the cup across the room and stomping off to the audience's cheer.
#Yngrid Adventure 1_2.84fad7ca-63bd-42ec-8a1e-4d25bbaf9e28;That's my contact. I guess we need to play for the information.

Choose wisely and the artifact will be yours."\n\nYngrid watches the dealer just like the player before her, slowly moving her hands over the cups one after the other. The dealer's eye twitches as she reaches the right cup.

You see, all these people here are my patrons. This is my tavern. And you know how unruly people get when no one is there to pour the beer."\n\nAll around you, chairs scrape against the floor, and weapons scrape against sheaths.

"You'll need to play for that information."\n\nHe shows you a single walnut, places a cup over it and two more to its sides. He shuffles them, then looks at you slyly.\n\n"Well?"

You catch his face twitching again, barely visible, as she moves over the left cup. Yngrid fixates him with an intent stare and thinks aloud.\n\n"Your eye twitching is just a ruse. You use it to lull players into a false sense of security. So, the correct cup is..."
#Yngrid Adventure 1_2.d58d1fc6-3121-4c58-979a-871150a1f09a;He raises the cup, but there is no walnut underneath. Yngrid quickly grabs the other two and a walnut rolls away.\n\n"You know I don't cheat, young lady! That hurts my feelings. Another round, hmm? Maybe that'll prove my honor."

She immediately motions for the pouch in front of him, smirking, and he laughs loudly.\n\n"You got me. A clever young lady, I'll admit.

As you move closer, you see orcish slavers around a pit trap, looking down in amusement as slaves quail at their warg guards.\n\nIn the pit is a lone man, trying tirelessly to climb the steep walls. He never makes it more than half way, and they are already slippery with blood from his raw hands and knees. A never ending stream of maddened pleas erupt from his mouth.\n\n"Let me out! Let me ouuuuut! I need to go! I have to! I have to!"

To your surprise, a small band of Shaikan mercenaries are sitting, drinking and eating.\n\nPerhaps they know something of Hokan's plans, or have seen something of the Hollow Guards empowered by Elynn's sisters essence.
#Elynn Adventure 2_3.63c74e0e-a7db-4d33-85e3-94ecdd4a61bd;You there! Tell me what you know!

#Philo Hiring.8eec95f4-4c93-4c1a-8725-17b1f8c4ed33;"Good day. My name is Philo Heath. I have come because a strange dream haunts me. When the darkest hour of night falls, I see a book and a tower, much like yours. It is suddenly ripped apart by a shadow. And, sometimes, I awaken in strange places, not knowing how I got there.\n\nI can't explain it. Can you... make it stop? Can you help me?"
#Philo Adventure 1.1d350b98-c388-4547-9452-52cdba37df70;After a hard day's walk, Philo suddenly stops in his tracks. He stares intently at a ruin not far away.\n\n"This... that is the tower from my dreams. Look. There is a dark spot at the top, almost like it burned."
#Philo Adventure 1.05a43f41-dd9d-44a9-ad1d-291bfd644d13;Maybe we can finally find out more.
#Philo Adventure 2.14897750-4068-49a0-8ae9-c2b89a9c410f;The tome that Philo has given you, or rather that Mathu'Gar gave you, turns out to be both diary and study journal. The owner, Horrucs, tried to control the demon's power by imprisoning it in the boy's body.\n\nPhilo's soul must have resisted, repressing the dark invader. A soulstone was used in the ritual - it might just be what is necessary to reverse it as well. But it could also cost one of their lives.\n\nThe book also mentions a general of the New Purity of Light in charge of those special stones.
#Philo Adventure 2.61cf454a-5462-4dfc-9c89-4134fe3fd6f4;I should find them.
#Philo Adventure 2_2.55027941-e5ec-4168-a588-9c54321a6701;Having collected all you need for the ritual to separate Philo and Mathu’Gar, the excitement in both is visible. The body shifts from human boy to waving shadows in mere moments as both fight to stay on the surface of consciousness, reverting just as quickly.\n\n"Please, help me, master! He is getting stronger! I can feel it! I promise myself to your cause! I..."\n\n"Don't listen to the youngling's whining! Which of us can grant you infinite power?!"
#Philo Adventure 2_2.340df851-a697-4817-b9ee-10956aa81d4c;Stay strong, Philo. We will get through this.
#Philo Adventure 2_2.071b3715-641f-4a22-9b03-b2442db21f69;We will be a force to be reckoned with, Mathu'Gar!

In their panic, their stakes fail and the beast's wings beat the netting away. A wild headbutt sends one of the troops crashing to the floor before the griffon joins its brethren in the sky. Soon, Hokan's troops lie dead or run screaming, and the griffons start trying to peck the Hollow Guard to destruction.

It is as though a shock wave pushed everything to the walls, toppled shelves and destroyed vials. At the top most room, you halt in the doorway. The floor is covered in dried blood. What you can only assume was once a human body lies flattened in the room's center. Everything is covered in sulfur and coal dust. A dark, leather bound book lies almost hidden under some debris.

#Goldenfields Healer 1.f2b32e92-abff-46e4-a8e3-68d3c875ee37;In Dire Need
#Goldenfields Healer 1.a046d69e-80d1-4006-b042-ae058e016244;When you enter the market, you find most stalls empty, and only a handful of people clusted around the well. There, a man in white robes is submerging a fish in a bucket. After only a few moments, the splashing stops, and the fish floats belly up.\n\n"It is as I thought. The water is poisoned. Alas, my cupboards are empty - I am unable to help."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.7a4dd195-9ca0-4202-82fa-03261874e879;Your well is poisoned? How did this happen?
#Goldenfields Healer 1.d2bc5142-6114-4468-969a-ad54c38e836b;The people start explaining their desperate attempts to stop a pest.\n\n"We thought those large insects were gone, but just recently they reemerged. They eat our crops, kill our animals. We had no choice but to stop them, so we turned to poison. Unfortunately, it seems to have soaked into the grounds and reached our wells. Whoever drinks from them gets sick.\n\nWe don't have the resources to heal so many. A lot already drank from the water."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.0d48d000-a61c-49e5-942f-5094675c6f73;I can offer you healing potions.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.6b434185-bea8-4968-93d7-b43ef90f084b;How can we cleanse the waters?
#Goldenfields Healer 1.5c90127b-47ef-4ae3-8afb-ac31d351648b;The villagers and their healer take the offering with reverence.\n\n"Humble thanks, master mage. These will provide temporary relief, but it is sorely needed. We need to cleans the waters too though, lest more become sick. Would you be able to get us some healing herbs? I can provide directions as to where you can find them."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.a26aaf7f-7632-49dc-b6b9-ed94b9e96956;We will bring you what you need.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.843d4e4e-cdd3-4e92-9813-a87896a610c1;I'm sorry. We have no time for this.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.990ae1d5-1e20-4fa7-8b3c-8401afdb053d;"We understand. You have already helped us greatly. We shall send some of our bravest. Hopefully they can return swiftly. Many thanks, master mage."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.efa689a7-45fd-4db1-9bb1-913538aaaf6d;Fare well. Good health to you all.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.c98aae93-5c05-4f3d-b849-62e58dc9befd;Please, take this Lenya.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.e7ee7f78-d14d-40a1-bc1f-d784dd6499f7;The village begins to cheer as the healer takes your offering with many thankful nods.\n\n"You are sent by the Guardians themselves! Our gratitude, master mage. You saved this small community from extinction."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.b1e10980-2161-4974-9085-8193e4e7de24;Good health to you all.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.b16a3204-533f-46a9-9180-13337c59236d;"If we had more healing herbs, we could eliminate the poison. I can provide directions, if you are willing to bring us some? I know multiple sources, but we only need a little. You can keep the rest as compensation for your work."
#Goldenfields Healer 1.7a8223fa-9468-4f39-afb0-a35aaf7e7d19;We will get what you need.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.245b1a62-3a65-473b-aaa8-d1addd12c9c7;We already have Lenya you can use.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp.ce1241ae-84d6-4b0e-ba97-467e907d7dd7;A messenger comes up to you, huffing but offering a quick salute.\n\n"Please, I have a message from Baron Halvier, master of the city of Lyraine and liege of Goldenfields. A caravan carrying much needed supplies to the palace has been stopped and plundered by bandits. If you would take care of them, and secure the stolen goods, my lord would reward you handsomely."\n\nHe bows, and then waits for an answer.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp.500fca4d-9816-43fc-8902-339ceccd70fa;Tell us where to find them.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp.af7fdc86-86a5-41fc-9c40-ab6457c0633c;We don't have time for this.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.f8553a8d-2408-4a4e-a547-68967504d428;You find the camp exactly where you were told it would be. There is little movement among the tents and huts. It seems likely your army has not been spotted.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.9b77ea6a-f963-4268-a32e-c36d3e9b2881;Rush them!
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.eebbf046-5ebf-42f2-8c5e-220be5626564;Watch a while.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.c0ca2830-7796-4cf5-bfab-e684248e7929;Your troops begin their approach, rushing towards the camp when suddenly a huge orc steps out from one of the tents, shaking an empty sack. He looks up, sees your army coming down the hillside and bellows loudly. Dozens of orcs quickly appear, ready to meet your attack. This is not a simple bandit camp.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.d5a766e2-5211-4d39-957e-3e38445991e4;Your scouts sneak closer to the campsite, but you hardly need their reports as you quickly spot the burly figures moving among the tents. Orcs are kicking through stacks of goods, rummaging through tents and sniffing at empty casks. It is no bandit camp.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.70a7d108-749a-4346-b84a-cfe8b1936024;We are already committed. Fight!
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.5445d768-677e-40f7-84e9-3e2b007e2fe8;Let me handle this.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.9aa9f2de-9a63-408d-994c-9bea886a30c0;Raiders! Charge!
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.3d663434-c8c6-4ed7-9405-0ddc68fa1969;Let me talk to them. Maybe they'll join us.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.d91d84d3-5847-4f61-b86c-ef0916307432;Galtrak approaches the band's leader and you bear witness to a grunted exchange. After a few words in their language, the orcs split into two parties. Some walk away with angry growls, but others follow Galtrak as he returns to you with a toothy smile.\n\n"They say everyone was dead when they arrived. Since they didn't get the chance to loot much, they'd rather join us than be stranded here."
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.0c429f45-da42-4788-b909-4024089c45d5;You quickly find that nearly everything in the camp that could be eaten has at least been chewed upon. Even the wooden tent poles look like something tried to bite into them. Chitinous carapaces crunch under foot, as if armies of bugs had died here. Or... molted?
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.7a3faff5-52dc-4c86-975e-8dac1ec0ae52;So be it. Now, let's look at that camp.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.1bddd22a-70b1-4e18-b7ed-62ab58e6104a;We don't need them. Let's focus on the camp.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.c70b8293-b36b-4ec1-97ad-40a5d3103298;Send a message to the Baron explaining this. Our work is done.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.08530dd1-5b6a-4705-be34-14d0789634d7;The Orcs drive you off, hollering and waving their arms, praising Zarach for the fight.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.d0611fec-b99c-46aa-82a9-fc5e0ec05e82;You pick through what is left of the goods you were sent here to collect. Everything not made of metal is gone or spoiled. Very little of use remains. Even the bandit corpses have been chewed on, as if by wild animals. Their wounds don't match orcish weapons.\n\nFlies hover above the camp and chitinous carapaces crunch underfoot. Bugs are everywhere.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.7ffb1f7e-6c0f-4ef0-ab9a-65008b29d506;Let's send message to Lyraine.
#Goldenfields_Banditcamp2.fd9cced2-7327-42c1-a1fc-4d17ae8b8800;Regroup elsewhere.

#Goldenfields Healer 1.4f828c82-f95d-4bfd-9e07-6a4c61bac310;The village is still largely empty, many inhabitants still sick. The healer walks between the houses, comforting where he can and easing the pain as much as possible.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.6406d0ea-a3c5-4ab1-a0c2-a6e7b311ab4e;We need to get the healer those herbs.
#Goldenfields Healer 1.73e4c00e-0431-4802-8373-4401b20de722;We brought some Lenya to help the sick.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1.c63af0dc-7476-4ddc-aa2d-248a9e9edef8;In the wake of Goldenfields' giant bug outbreak, many a charlatan and fake witch has sprouted up, selling potions and charms to the innocent and naive, 'protecting them from the threat'.\n\nOne such fraud, Madame Myriel, has time and again avoided the Baron's attempts to unmask her lies and now he has turned to you for your help in doing so.\n\nToday, she plans to prove the effectiveness of her charms to a town. It is the perfect opportunity to uncover the truth.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1.afe3a257-c86b-465e-8806-8b4d98c8ea41;What is she planning, I wonder?
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.147e28fd-0257-402d-8d0d-6824d86eb89a;You arrive in town just as Madame Myriel is setting up in the market. It is full of people, all crowding around two large wagons. One is covered in fabrics. The other looks more like a circus wagon, big, bright and colorful.\n\nIt is from the door of the latter that an opulent woman walks, her silver curls artfully arranged and her lavish clothes glittering with beads and crystals.\n\n"Gather close, young and old! I have many a charm to sell!"
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.f797c772-6396-48eb-bd58-99d9124f0ab7;Investigate the wagons.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.016f05ea-3428-470b-90e0-604dbda9cf1b;"Many of you have heard of the beasts roaming our lands!" Myriel starts. She has climbed a crate and is looking over the villagers. "Awful things. But fear not, for I have brought you hand-crafted charms! These are sure to frighten off any large bugs. Guaranteed! Don't believe me? Believe your eyes!"\n\nWith a flourish she tears the fabric from the wagon, revealing a cage with a giant bug inside. She holds a charm up to the creature and it flees in the opposite direction, almost tangling its legs in the process.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.f95bd19f-2ca0-4d9d-b7ac-a60a475291e0;I can see the strings controlling its legs!
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.1dbba66e-3eef-429c-8214-df7b60dda774;Interesting. Perhaps she is legitimate?
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.77014083-f1a9-47f1-a9cd-cae289fb589b;A group of guards - no more than thugs with chipped and rusting weapons really - stops anyone from coming close.\n\n"No one is to near Madam Myriel's wagons! If you want to see the show, stand over there!"
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.97568d0c-ca5d-4c34-9c23-dbe1943165df;Then we will force our way through. Attack!
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.60c4b2d7-6ea0-4543-81db-6bc3d1630090;Oh, we're here for added security. 
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.97f1e611-e511-4c23-aedc-eec54cbbaffb;Will this convince you to spill her secrets?
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.7068c50d-845c-4750-87ba-be802799ecac;"You really think we're that stupid?! Step away. This is your last warning."
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.46e86f95-d3d6-44e8-904c-9b1a549ebf4e;"Finally! Move over there then. We need more people around the second wagon!"\n\nYou take position by the wagon covered in fabrics. As Madame Myriel begins to talk, you see two people vanish underneath them, careful not to be seen by the townsfolk. A moment later, you hear a very slight 'click'.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.b6c0a675-5945-4bac-a38d-757e520d41a2;While the town panics at the outburst of violence, Madame Myriel is ushered into her wagon. They take off while the guards dismantle your band.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.652554f3-beed-451a-9923-9f68fa66c079;She will not get far.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.ad39bc06-cbe5-4fed-a834-52a5caab188f;The guard captain, if he can be called that, pretends not to pay attention as he subtly accepts the offered coin. With that he has his soldiers usher others away and leans in close.\n\n“She is a charlatan, alright, offering useless trinkets for coin. If someone here were to pay attention to the underside of that wagon, they might find a surprise. Now, off with you, before we’re caught.”
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.fa0f8005-7102-492d-af8a-bfec29c31080;People here are very wary of your troops, but they relax when they see your colors and banners.\n\n"It's just... The baron's soldiers stationed nearby." An elderly man tries to explain. "They turned real funny. Suddenly plundering our granaries and fields. More than they could ever eat! And then they took it all with 'em when they left! We're 'fraid you were more of the same. But then... Well, if you could maybe help us get back the grain? Taxes be comin', an' the baron won't be pleased when we've got nothin' to give."
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.f3691fbb-9bb1-4a19-a98d-e044275d9879;Where did these soldiers go?
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.72c9f52f-b706-4264-8e44-bcee8654b6f2;I'm no errand runner.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.7129ce8f-573c-4b1f-8daa-0da6b93a6c45;Your band dutifully follows their directions. You stumble across a small group of soldiers much sooner than you thought you would. They don't seem very soldierly, though. They may wear the Baron's colors, but they stumble about confused, and several of them keep scratching at their faces, leaving bloody streaks.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.ceb63231-cb0a-4c0a-9ded-7b2bbb408eb1;They seem disorganized. Attack!
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.2796f441-4dc8-4906-be4c-c4440d393473;Watch them a little longer.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.bc077414-0cfb-4fde-a362-7a173d7fa85a;Among the soldiers, your scouts make out bugs swarming. Insects of all sizes, from tiny specks to the size of a child's head. One of the soldiers suddenly screams and tries to run, but is held back by their comrades.\n\nThen they see you, and become agressive. Somehow, they manage some semblance of a fighting formation.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.24bcbcc2-0294-4aa3-8a8b-9b3a55d5ae3f;I guess we'll have to fight.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.b744e8a2-efa6-412d-97c4-8d0b9ad1b7fa;You hardly believe it, but when the Baron's soldiers wildly attack, your troops falter.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.45b2131b-6ea7-4ce5-b53e-375a362eb510;Save yourselves! Run!
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.d9080932-1671-46c0-bda1-050aef7b6808;While your soldiers take care of the last stumbling fighters, one of them breaks away and flees. He moves jerkily, like a child's puppet, but seems to follow a straight line away from the battlefield.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.0fdd4165-bb56-43ce-8b9e-364ce965dbe3;There must be more. Follow him!
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.d639d7d2-e704-4473-8633-239c913e0a94;The Traitor Army
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.1de6aaf6-fdde-4c73-a8da-0cddf7c7805e;The lone soldier has been running without pause for hours, but eventually comes to a camp where the Baron's banners flap haphazardly in the wind. It seems more orderly than the group you fought before, but your scouts also spy a few troops stumbling about aimlessly.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.46d24cd4-7f5f-4c7d-9d8e-7915579e24f5;Try to talk to them first.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.e93609f2-5091-4083-9591-708279ac3217;Your troops catch one of the aimlessly wandering soldiers and question them. They cannot get any straight answer. The soldier mumbles, and then yells. Finally they just begin screaming: "It's inside my head! My head! I hear it moving and scratching... GET IT OUT!"\n\nHis screeching alerts the camp.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.b04d7506-b11c-4574-8711-7bbaeb912bcc;Damn it. Attack!
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.4c898f0a-4915-4688-b6b3-190e86ed9b90;When the fight ends, only the leader still stands, eyes glazed over and looking far past your soldiers. When he is struck down, he lies still for a moment before beginning to twitch and convulse. Then, to everyone's horror, an insect bursts from his left eye, buzzing its blood-spattered wings.\n\nOne of your lieutenants swats at the creature and then tramples it underfoot until it no longer moves.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy2.c256fa02-2786-45f9-b7d8-c78862b1236d;Burn it all.

#Lyraine_Party.db0eeafa-adf2-4a34-801a-2318fb9fb59e;Messengers from the baron and local guilds come to you accompanied by trumpeters, drummers and petal throwers.\n\n"Hear ye, hear ye!" a crier reads from a scroll. "For Goldenfields' heroes, the Baron Halvier of Lyraine has made ready a great feast and a day and night of merriment! Please, good people, come to the Inn of the First Crossroads! Dance, eat and drink until the sun rises again!"\n\nThey hand over official invitations and directions to the inn. It seems the people of Lyraine want to show their gratitude after you have solved so many problems.
#Lyraine_Party.477e6f00-dbfd-4ded-8111-047932280f95;Let's head to the inn!
#Lyraine_Party2.b16f104c-ad6b-413a-ae57-7886ca6ecee3;A Well-Deserved Feast
#Lyraine_Party2.49367282-333e-4e16-a50e-232c47a18c0e;The feast is all that was promised and more. Mead, wine and food are plenty. Musicians play for your company, people dance and everyone toasts to your health.\n\nMuch later, in the dead of night, when the candles have burned low and many are getting ready to sleep, a scream rouses you all. Another scream comes, followed by the loud clicking of mandibles. The inn is under attack!
#Lyraine_Party2.079aa362-bf89-4b82-affc-745f3418fc97;Prepare to fight!
#Lyraine_Party2.86238975-e095-414c-a497-272e0dd0820f;Quickly! I will protect you with magic!

#Lyraine_Party2.e0dcddc7-1fde-4b36-80d6-191f5060c31f;Now we fight.
#Lyraine_Party2.730c162c-b1ba-41ec-9635-1ef2187739c8;Wading through dozens of bug cadavers, you all come back to sobriety. You are all dour. Your celebrations were poorly timed - as it has been for months, Goldenfields is still infested with bugs.\n\nThe inn is completely ruined, but you are given gold in thanks for your aid and in compensation, the feast in your honor being so rudely interrupted.
#Lyraine_Party2.30ea780f-5e36-4db7-bf3e-d65298c81ce5;We need to find out more.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.0b74e739-a18d-46f4-bd6c-e76d65a5a7f1;Pleasure doing business with you.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.b1ea455e-3c77-46d0-b329-f891e8a2e5f0;The townsfolk are certainly taken by your accusation, looking cautiously at Madame Myriel to prove her innocence.\n\n"How unjust!" she cries. "Can you not see it moving? Can you not hear its unnerving calls?"\n\nRight at that moment, the bug makes a noise that sounds like a mixture of rasping and screeching.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.dd794864-dace-4493-abf4-f53544e64a71;Show us the cage! Now!

#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.3cdb5c26-829c-4452-8b88-cd36c0eae1a9;Myriel blanches at the townsfolk start to murmur and then call out for more proof.\n\nFor a moment it looks like she might run, but then she gives in to the angry shouts of the people and pulls the fabric beneath the cage up. Everyone sees two men in the small space, holding sticks and strings in place to move the bug from below.\n\nThe Baron's guards arrive in the afternoon to take Myriel into custody. The townsfolk are outraged, and thank you for helping them keep their well earned coin.

I found a dead bug and saw an opportunity! Here!" She shows you a secret compartment underneath the cage. "My soldiers use sticks and strings to move the bug from here. It was just meant to be a harmless prank!"\n\nThe baron's guards come to take the charlatan away a little later, and the townsfolk praise you for revealing the truth.
#Lyraine City Adventure 1_2.1a744947-271e-4dbe-aced-3976076f0d38;The baron will take it from here. Fare well.

#Alluvyan Curse 1.eb2f18aa-77a6-41d9-80b9-fd849d8043b8;You come across a remote village, where bees spread the smell of honey and a constant buzzing fills the air. \n\nSuddenly you hear children screaming. They come running past you in a panic, closely followed by a pack of large wolves.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.10b125ea-c3b4-4509-b46b-c148936287da;Defend them and kill those wolves!
#Alluvyan Curse 1.200bae34-c5f7-4f43-b355-7ab811f548e4;There is a magical essence coming from the wolves.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.0ee91a46-9178-4fc8-adf2-7943a6725761;Those are not wolves. Their movements don't follow natural patterns.

#Alluvyan Curse 1.6cffd791-5232-42a8-b8ce-d61870097459;You start to kill the wolves one by one, but more come out of the houses. Without warning, one of the children flings themselves between you and the animal that you are currently fighting.\n\n"Noooo! Not my mama! Stop!" The child sniffles and tears run down their chubby cheeks. "Our parents went and chopped some trees a couple days ago. That night, all adults were turned into wolves. But they are still good! I swear!"\n\nYou look around and see all the other children crying, clinging to the giant canines.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.6cbc904c-50f6-45f5-b98a-69cfbc0e5593;Are you saying your parents were cursed?
#Alluvyan Curse 1.bd976b34-e530-4481-81ae-f245cb089bd9;The girl nods, smearing snot all over the wolf and her face in the process.\n\n"Mama said the elves here guard the healing herbs too jealously.

#Alluvyan Curse 1.ff3d7084-e3b0-4e8a-af27-8fcd38af0e96;The children run off, searching the houses for coins as if it was a game. The wolves follow them, growling occasionally in your direction but never attacking.\n\nShortly afterwards, the children pile up their findings on a tablecloth before you. It is a quite a big sum. Probably all they have.\n\n"Will you turn them back now?"
#Alluvyan Curse 1.785e2382-e97f-4672-baab-d903f2fca1b5;Of course. Show us where your parents went.

#Alluvyan Curse 1.a4db96a0-980a-4492-beb0-d03b78367e02;You are brought to a very small and clear pond. The water shimmers turquoise, and you can see Lenya growing around it in small patches. It is true, the plant is fiercely protected, as it is difficult to grow and increasingly rare, particularly in the Highmark. As such, it is no surprise to see a handful of elves step out from behind nearby trees.\n\n"Have you come back for more, you greedy hairless apes?"
#Alluvyan Curse 1.46c72570-a6ea-497c-9eb0-36b68ef4d050;You did this to the villagers? Will you undo it?
#Alluvyan Curse 1.7aa37938-4741-4ed4-ac40-e963b90fc1a4;"We will undo it if they promise never to come here again in their lifetime. Elen's Grace needs more time to grow than you have. We warned the humans of this weeks ago and they didn't listen! We told them there would be consequences!"\n\nSome of the wolves snarl and growl. Others whimper.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.728df474-b3fc-4172-96e6-734b285c5b95;You’ll die for the curse you have spoken!
#Alluvyan Curse 1.6028038d-0e19-4eb8-9a21-dddf630da4e3;A warm wave of golden light rolls out from the fallen elves. You feel something like a pressure lifting.\n\nBehind you, the wolves turn back into humans, and the children hug their parents tightly.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.ead72db5-38f1-4f6c-9b98-45c1bc1423c5;Let this be a warning to leave the Lenya alone.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.a0032b91-1013-424e-9acf-cf42ffcae710;Let's go before the remember we took their gold.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.9d97fc75-d10a-48e2-a27e-50650ace9e29;The villagers approach you warily, keeping distance between them, their children and your troops.\n\n"Thank you for your help, master mage. We will never touch it again, that is for sure."
#Alluvyan Curse 1.6d263b36-2829-4d37-9711-fc933f26b28d;Good. We shall take our leave now.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.30b91af7-4634-4756-8728-b9b287cbe903;There is not even time for your soldiers to retreat before the elves tear into them.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.849a44b4-05b4-4de6-9f7b-1910b4e249a4;I will show them the same mercy.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.53dd72ba-d3b0-4280-b5e0-18ca601615fb;If you can’t be reasonable, neither can we.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.2854712d-b225-4557-901f-8ceffee9c7fa;Then the Lenya harvesting ends now. Yes?
#Alluvyan Curse 1.fa150c76-6257-4fcd-8700-272d5ad1f729;After what seems like debate, the wolves go quiet.\n\n"It is agreed then. Should they return, their fate will be worse."\n\nThe elves speak a few words and the villagers return to their original form. On seeing their parents, the children cry and give them joyous hugs. The adults quickly step back from the pond and the blue leaves growing around it.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.6099860e-2b40-4f3c-882b-f046b77b12a6;Let’s get going, before they remember the gold.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.83d43ce7-1c65-42f5-8c42-167ce0abec68;This should be warning enough. We will be gone now.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.54f5c9c1-9389-420e-ad16-648943248cc5;The children follow you, but the wolves are faster. Within moments, they are between you and the children. To your surprise, the children laugh, and some even hop onto the wolves' backs. The large canines growl at you, baring sharp teeth.\n\n"Are you here to rid our parents of the curse?" one of the children asks. Tears build up in her eyes as she afixes you with a desperate stare.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.14583486-b6ed-452d-a836-3910a50177f5;Are you talking about the wolves?
#Alluvyan Curse 1.2406d2d6-382a-4afb-aa67-c53843cb9ad6;Almost as if to answer your unasked question, the wolves position themselves in front of the children in a protective manner.\n\n"Are you here to rid our parents of the curse?" one of the children asks. Tears build up in her eyes as she afixes you with a desperate stare.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.4154724a-997d-4914-b6c0-d67733233e9b;Are you talking about the wolves?
#Alluvyan Curse 1.4d15238b-d235-49b1-aef1-b4c2bc86eedc;You find the children standing on the wolves' backs, trying to pick apples and cherries from the trees in the village.\n\n"Hey! You came back! Can you lift the curse from our parents now?"
#Alluvyan Curse 1.f5eb472b-27d6-4290-858f-0030a903a83c;Sorry children, not yet. We will come back.
#Alluvyan Curse 1.e8d562a6-6be0-4b25-96e8-fd4d1369a7f2;Yes, indeed. Show us where your parents went before the curse.
#Alluvyan Wolves 1.b9ead1c5-5950-4d41-8984-d7406ab8ffd6;Wolves have been pestering Alluvyan's villages for some time now. The people have begun offering rewards to anyone who can prove they have killed some of the beasts.

Our numbers are dwindling and the humans keep growing."

Quick, before they come any closer!"\n\nA scuffle unfolds. Pressing on, you find a group of dwarves in the process of breaking open a door in the stone face. It must be a storage cave, where Adamantinum and mining equipment is kept.

A stone statue of Tiara, her dress poised perfectly with her dancing feet, has been smeared with foul vegetables. Other parts of the small shrine have collapsed entirely. Four dwarves are cleaning up the mess, praying to her fervently for forgiveness.
#Windholme Fanatics 1.7b023537-2b12-4fdb-82cd-e70eaf50ffc3;How peculiar.
#Windholme Fanatics 1.2355d563-3ede-493f-86f2-30b3c4772cd2;What happened here?

Tiara is important to us, so we are greatly pained. I fear it was an act of rebellion, of the Granite Dwarves. Windholme declined to help them fight some troll from Norgate."

HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS1.Title;A surprise
HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS1.Description;A young paladin - Lytra Storme - warned me of an impending attack today. I am unsure of her motives, her once following The New Purity, but she did excel in battle. We shall see what she brings.
HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS2.Title;The New Purity
HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS2.Description;The Purity are fanatics, gathered after the Mage Wars under Rondar Lacaine. They teach that our using magic prevents Aonir from healing the world. \n\nBefore they were disgraced, they took it upon themselves to eradicate mages. Now, we know their vision of Aonir was false, sent to them by an ancient creature from beyond the veil.
HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS3.Title;Purity Methods
HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS3.Description;Fervent in their belief, the Purity does not quail at extreme measures, torturing the magically gifted until their minds break and they lose their gift, or die screaming.

HeroPage.LytraStorme.MS4.Description;The Stormes have served the Highmark for generations, watching over the Westguard and the coast. Their head, Rengar Storme, Lord of Stormwatch Faste, is one of the Purity faithful. I fear it has twisted his mind and soul.

#lytra Adventure 3_5.23c0a15d-456b-493c-90f1-6c83012389c0;Lytra should be here to meet her father one last time.
#lytra Adventure 3_5.4d130a71-96cc-4b76-ae5a-945a667a81c9;Rengar Storme's camp is surrounded by Purity forces and protected by his own trained griffons too. If you wish to get to him, you will have to go through both. And all are ready for a fight too.\n\nLytra rides forward nonetheless, shouting across the din: "Face me, Father! One last time, remember the honor of our house! Do not rely on the Purity to fight your battles for you!"\n\nThe noise dies down as everyone seems to wait for a reply.
#lytra Adventure 3_5.07c121b1-882e-45e6-b1b0-41c73354887b;Wait.
#lytra Adventure 3_5.b57443ba-af6f-45e0-84dc-cd7099221998;Attack now!

#lytra Adventure 3_5.bdb1f3e9-8a04-4025-8301-85eacdd4dea1;Finally, Rengar emerges. He is slumped over, a robed man in the white robe of the Purity at his side.\n\nThe robed figure points at you and Rengar weakly gives the order to join battle. By now, the griffons are more uncertain, giving you an opening.
#lytra Adventure 3_5.e26a151d-9bb7-4baa-92d8-e13a9eafa02e;He is no longer his own master. Let us finish this.
#lytra Adventure 3_5.37a994bd-94f9-4729-91a2-9ae0fd86ff94;The moment the fighting is done, Lytra races to Rengar's side, practically skidding to a halt by his body. Tears stream down her face as she tries to whisper him back to life. Then, she clutches his hands and buries her head in his chest, sobbing loudly.\n\n"...could you not just have listened?!..." is all you catch between her heaving breaths.

"They were ours by right of conquest, but there was so little Adimantinum to be found there that we moved our miners to larger veins. That does not mean they were unclaimed. We have been robbed!"\n\n"What you stole in a time of war must be given back to the rightful owner when you lose," a Windwall delegate argues. "They were rich mines then.

As a sign of gratitude they leave you with a discreet gift. Zirassa stays silent until they too have gone back to their camp.\n\n"I expect the dwarves of the Windwall Mountains will mount some sort of military operation to reclaim their mines," she says.

If you do not work together now, this could threaten all of your operations. And that will affect you both, whether you agree or not."

As that goes on, the leading Granite Dwarf glumly signals for his delegation to head back to their camp. Immediately, the Windholme delegation does the same. Zirassa shakes her head in disappointment, and speaks to you when all the dwarves have left.\n\n"Things are not any worse than they were," she says. "But they have not improved. Yria will be disappointed."
#Yria Rep 3 Adventure 2_1.e92d4ac1-e68f-4248-8b68-8e9033bd43fc;"Enough to fulfill our contracts for two seasons," the Windwall delegation tells you.

They both head off back to their camps and Zirassa congratulates you.\n\n"This was probably the best outcome. It will not last, but for the time being, true crisis has been averted. Yria will be impressed. Please accept this for your time and efforts."
#Yria Rep 3 Adventure 2_1.9efaec76-3edc-4f3b-808c-ba974d53bbd8;I am glad I could help.

We shall look into the Adamantinum shortage and get to the root cause."\n\n"And for the right price we are willing to trade some of our reserves," the Granite Dwarves say. "At least until the situation is resolved."

A pack of wolves circles a nearby tree, where a man and small girl cling to the branches, holding on for dear life.\n\nAs you watch, the man's foot slips and the girl screams, "Papa!" Right at the last moment, a wolf snapping at his heel, he manages to pull himself back up again. "It's all right, sweetheart!" He shouts. "I'm alright!"

#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.246c4e37-1f0e-4cd2-84f2-bd36c7f71ca7;Hold! Who are you?!
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.fe9eef64-a13e-4a13-aa0e-f9383ea8cedd;I will pretend not to have noticed.
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.e493cfd5-625e-48d3-bb7c-c41657f029b2;From that moment, you keep your eyes ahead of you and march on as if nothing had happened.\n\nOnly after a few moments do you dare glance back. You think you catch a pair of gleaming eyes peeking out at you from a large patch of see grass that floats listlessly in the water. Not a moment later, the shadows cover them and they are gone, but the sea grass shakes and waves for a moment as though something has swum out of it.
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.b98a218e-a73d-422b-8965-db1f15753d41;Perhaps merpeople are real...
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.ab0de8d5-b8e9-466e-a718-16d1958595bd;There is no response for a moment, but when you don't move, a groan floats through your head, before you hear a harsh, rasping voice say: "Dammit!"\n\nA creature with the head and torso of a woman, but with a long and scaly, shimmering tail reveals herself from a large patch of sea grass nearby.\n\n"I was rather hopin' you didnae see me." Her voice floats through your mind as she looks at you. "We're nae sposed to be seen by all yous."
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.c70a4821-62be-4b9c-9681-e2d28ea32b0f;This must be some trick. Surely?

#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.86959c0d-0afd-4554-a403-9a993d2843ca;She waves an uncaring hand and gives you an amused smile as the sunlight ripples across her scales.\n\n"None ever cares about what chilren have to sae," she says. "It's those like you we're woorried aboot. We do nae wan' to be hunted for oor magic."
Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.6bcc619e-93b0-45bf-bdda-a93086edb186;Perhaps you can buy my silence.

#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.6d68692a-9b16-4030-848c-ef4b02617f86;"Nae! Nae trick." her voice floats through your mind again as she makes an annoyed face. "We keep ooselves secret so tha' we're nae hunted. Yous like magic, righ'? Yoo'd hunt us for tha'."
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.b74eea03-5d0d-4910-b715-13f6d781842e;"Bless yeh!" A beaming smile crosses the woman's face and she turns herself around in such a tight circle that her long hair twists through the water.\n\n"Thank yeh. Please, take this, and mae the blessin's of the deep go with yeh!"\n\nShe puts two gentle fingers to her tail and jolts as she snaps off a scale to hand to you. It glows with ethereal energy. Before you can respond, she twists through the water and powers away into the merk, disappearing before your very eyes.
#Three Lakes Mermaid 1_1.3d6b3578-e01e-4943-92cf-285c96d99286;The mermaid bares two rows of very sharp, pointed teeth in a kind of frustrated grimace before she puts two gentle, webbed fingers to her own tail and jolts, snapping off a scale that glows with ethereal energy. She swims over to offer it to you, avoiding eye contact.\n\n"Maybe this'll be useful to yeh," she says. "Let's hope we never see each other again."\n\nWith that, she twirls around and powers away through the water, disappearing into the mirk without another word.

Sure enough, a member of your company is watching them nervously as they stand with their backs to the camp in quiet conversation.\n\nAs you catch some of the words, you recognize that you don't know the language. In fact you couldn't even guess at it.
#Uram Rep 2 Adventure 2.ded8f43d-af0b-4e31-8bf0-bf7ae12e4712;It's probably nothing.

Soon all three of them are facing you. Behind them, you hear a sharp crackling sound and, for just a moment, the air smells heavily and sickly like sulfur.
#Uram Rep 2 Adventure 2.485ea0c4-d2e5-4440-8dc0-bb2051f8033e;Uram sent you!
#Uram Rep 2 Adventure 2.6b0693ac-5563-428f-bf58-0fc1997ac0ea;Before you can react, one of the travelers takes out a small vial and smashes it into the ground, thick, acrid smoke quickly rising from the shattered glass and choking the camp. You hear another crack and choke as you swallow down the smoke and the air.\n\nWhen you make your way clear of the chaos, the spies are nowhere to be seen. Vanished through a gate that is untraceable now it's gone.
#Uram Rep 2 Adventure 2.f2ff1bae-c801-408e-81cc-6d0d7eca1647;We must be careful about travelers from now on.

#Uram Rep 3 Adventure 1.7f8a7f44-66a8-4673-ba03-752b0762d822;You hear the fluttering of wings and look to your tower window to find the crimson-colored raven landing on the stone, cocking its head and cawing at you in mockery of Uram's voice.\n\n"I require your aid in a complex ritual, mage. Help me and I will grant you control over one of the demons we bring forth."

Uram's voice bellows from its mouth angrily.\n\n"Fine!" he growls. "Would that you could see the power I am bringing to our world! Fine. I will find someone braver to aid me."\n\nWith that, the raven tears itself out of the fabric of this reality, disappearing in a puff of smoke.

#Uram Rep 3 Adventure 1_2.da10fe1b-c304-4d17-8ffa-6e91eff65b07;The ritual site is already a hive of activity when you arrive. Uram's soldiers march around, setting banners and wooden platforms around a large stone structure that looks frames the landscape behind it like a painting in a noble's hall.\n\nUram's apparition is directing the work, crackling and shimmering, giving off the faint smell of sulfur. As you approach, some soldiers drag a group of scared, chained prisoners towards the stone frame.
#Uram Rep 3 Adventure 1_2.94dbdb04-282d-4e1b-b003-3d5fdfd500ea;Who are the prisoners?
#Uram Rep 3 Adventure 1_2.1d11f491-926f-45cc-ba16-1a81341818bd;"Petty thieves and murderers," Uram replies after directing an acolyte away with a scroll. "One rogue mage who believed she could control all the Allfire. They will be sacrificed to open the ritual. Grim, but necessary.\n\nI am impressed that you have come.

#Uram Rep 3 Adventure 1_2.cd089485-52dc-4ef4-8718-4dcb04d0c601;Uram takes a moment to read a scroll that an acolyte comes dashing over with before replying: "The ritual must be performed in two steps. When I tell you, you must feed your power into the spell, else it will collapse. It will require a good amount of focus, so if you are not prepared now, come back when you are."

The flames spread around the gate until you can see the heat ripple into the air around it. The acolytes holding some of the prisoners sink terrible cerimonial daggers into their necks and throw them to the ground. The stones they lie on absorb the blood like water, there is a loud crackling in the center of the gate and a dark shroud opens up, filling the frame in a second.\n\nThe rest of the prisoners all look at you helplessly as Uram says, "Now!"

You lay your eyes on the heart of the demons' home, and watch as a group of them step through, looking at the situation with curious, alien eyes.\n\nUram stops chanting, instead casting a binding spell that will lock them to his will. He turns to you with a quizzical brow.

He barely registers you, getting right to the point. "I have no great trust for Hokan Ashir. His power has gone to his head and if we do not keep an eye on him, he may sweep the rest of us away.

"That is even more foolish.\n\nWell, I suppose the old adage holds some truth. If you want something done properly..."\n\nYou hold your breath as a crackle signals the coming of another small gate.

Lytra has made the task before you significantly easier.

#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.249febfe-e0c1-4a73-bcef-dc903a5d297f;"Come on, let's go!" A young man races past, leading a group of ruffians down the street. "Look! We need to go this way!"\n\nThey sprint down a side alley and are quickly gone. Your eyes are drawn to where the young man pointed, to a small carving etched into the wooden support of a low roof. Two crossed swords with a crown hovering over them, and an arrow pointing down the alley the ruffians ran into.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.47b9ad57-a042-4f90-83b6-b26846029df0;I wonder where it leads.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.0630f37f-4407-4eef-b2f8-6417724652c1;We don't have time for such distractions.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.ac2a1e63-d1db-43d1-aba0-d552404b4c47;The first symbol leads you to another, and then another, until you are led to a narrow, run down street and an old, dilapidated tavern with a worn coat of arms - two crossed swords under a barely visible crown. A bouncer stands outside, already eyeing you up.\n\n"Pay to enter," she says as she flexes strong, athletic muscles. "What happens behind these doors stays behind these doors."
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.5eab7722-ee48-4a73-859a-f39aed21fef1;Here's the fee.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.e013645b-aac9-43e7-b894-6a2fdcd313e0;Let us pass without charge.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.7e05910d-debf-4f1b-9eb0-01381d4f5fdd;We best be on our way.
Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.a78ebd52-b831-46c2-8530-cda09f51bb38;Go inside.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.d4caf699-4b25-43f9-824b-7894a4c5de6a;The bouncer opens up the coin pouch and gives it a good shake, takes out a coin and bites it. Only then does she give a satisfied nod. She reaches past her own shoulder to open the door, tilting her head to invite you in.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.2e45c470-8ab0-4c11-809a-645fb0925953;For a moment, the bouncer stares emptily at you. After a moment, she gives a deep sigh and reaches past her own shoulder to open the door, tilting her head to invite you in.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.527174f4-50a5-4e32-9f41-1df260c0fcf7;The tavern seems long abandoned but for the shouts and cheers coming from the bottom of a long flight of stairs.\n\nDescending, you quickly catch sight of people excitedly exchanging money and insults. You see the young man you followed here downing some ale with a grin on his face as he leans on a railing. The entire room is built around a shallow circular pit where a fight has just ended. A big, muscular fighter lies broken and unconscious on the floor. A demon stands over him, roaring with laughter as it stretches its neck.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.e6c85179-70e7-41ed-935b-956369fd960b;This can't possibly be legal. Shut it down!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.9488873a-69ea-44d4-94c4-7385614b5b53;I wonder if we can bet on the fights.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.eb456851-2773-49ce-82ec-0696d2e94c03;Is there a prize for beating the demon?
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.99430ae4-dd0c-4809-b43a-dc20faee7d38;As the fighter is dragged away, an announcer walks out into the pit and raises their arms as they twirl to meet the eyes of the whole crowd.\n\n"We probably should have seen that coming, right?!" They shout to raucous laughter. "Now! We got plenty of fighting left to do and anyone is welcome! Don't forget, there's more than just pride on the line! A large cash prize for anyone strong enough to face... 'The Fiend'! Ooooooooh!"
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.c5874501-56ed-4de5-b9c4-2eca840f717c;I don't think any of us can quite manage that.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.e87c09f1-c63e-4614-86bf-419ee90675d4;Lytra, do you think you can give it a go?
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.5c4a8e63-4f0b-47ed-a125-3429b210cc3b;My money is on the dwarf and the mole!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.a03b49de-1b71-4bb8-b30e-75327bc1c45a;Lytra gives you a wide-eyed stare before she groans and mutters: "I’ll need a helmet."\n\nDespite her hesitation, she naturally gives the fight her all. Even in her heavy armor, she jumps and dives about to avoid the demon’s strikes, blocking those she can’t with both weapon and shield. At one point, you are certain you see a white aura disperse around her with a flash.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.aaee280a-bf16-4244-b938-7216cd14d451;When the demon kicks her to the floor, raising itself up to shatter her rib cage, Lytra cries out fearlessly. Lifting herself up, she drives her weapon into the demon’s gut, only for the beast to collapse on top of her.\n\nThe crowd falls silent, unclear as to who has won the bout. Then, slowly, Lytra pulls herself out from underneath her fallen foe, throwing her borrowed helmet away. \n\nThe room explodes into enraptured applause.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.c090bfd7-4f02-4733-a3ce-41666ba0fd29;Your champion makes their way back out of the pit, quietly indicating to the announcer that they should pass you the prize. The announcer grins and tosses you a heavy bag of coins, and loudly shouts, "Drinks for the champions are on the house!"
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.fe3be9b8-783e-4b67-960d-2091cc94f1e2;The work isn't done yet. I want that demon.
Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.57289aae-ca94-40b1-9e8e-8b1f9fddaa7a;Come on! You can do this!
Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.2ec7b23e-6d95-49ca-a892-0102bb0a81b3;Yes! Well fought!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.bb383d7b-7d53-4642-a1e3-00b87b270252;Yngrid chokes on the drink she has already, somehow, procured but mumbles to herself and goes back up to retrieve Whiskey.\n\nThe mole is hesitant to enter the arena, but Yngrid eventually manages to cajole him inside. They charge straight at the demon, Whiskey stretching onto his two back legs to slam into it. It catches him so that they are locked wrestling with each other and Yngrid strikes at its head opportunistically.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.08cb0d74-e8f7-49b1-9921-5394db9df526;The demon growls and shoves and Whiskey topples over. Yngrid falls from the saddle with a loud cry and the crowd roars with approval but she is not defeated. As Whiskey runs circles around the demon, distracting it, Yngrid hammers at its heels, bringing it to its knees.\n\nIt twists and turns to swipe at her, knocking her backwards, but with the demon’s attention turned again, Whiskey leaps up and batters it into submission with his claws.\n\nThe audience love every moment, giving both Yngrid and Whiskey a massive round of applause.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.be4b7814-512a-48b2-a638-70f9890ec7f5;You spend some time enjoying the remaining fights, which are all spectacular, closer than you might expect and thoroughly enjoyed by the audience.\n\nWhen it is clear that there are no more challengers for the evening, the announcer bids the audience goodnight and the demon heads over to a few shadowy figures who have been paying close attention the whole night long.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.3ac41161-c482-4717-9e7a-ac72682cc6e9;I want that demon to join our forces.
Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.6efe035e-3afb-42dc-a3e8-ee902a921a23;We should get going now.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.77a53875-bb53-4f55-a89b-7384a849335f;Maybe this isn't such a good idea then.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.b881e9a5-d6a3-4119-911f-ca840891c993;Put money on the griffon.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.79b4f0e2-3c8a-4c9c-96f1-1ce38d1b7a39;Put money on the dogs.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.89658c5c-40db-49f5-870d-cf65a4b59298;Put money on the boxer.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.a1bc1ec6-6380-4118-9395-673534fc77e1;Before the next fight begins, you ask the announcer whether they know of any challengers who are already lined up.\n\n"Sure!" They laugh. "We've got a hunter who's put up his dogs to fight. Probably gonna be close, but not smart money if you ask me. We've got some idiot local boxer who's got a debt to settle with the Thieves Guild. He might die. The interesting one is a dwarf from the north. He's offered up a griffon. That'll be a good fight!"
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.a298cebe-2c7e-4391-b3b4-56a69416223a;A bad bet.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.67360f52-5110-40d7-841b-3d17b95fa664;As the announcer predicted, the boxer is very soundly beaten. The moment he squares up, he is slammed into the pit wall by a heavy punch that must break most of his ribs. From then on, it is more and more difficult to watch. You aren't sure the boxer is breathing at the end of it.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.8d1bb71b-9077-4b9a-9c43-aca75664695f;Argh! So close!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.86acae4e-3ed2-482d-ae64-15774ef74372;The dogs are well trained and surprisingly vicious. They run circles around the demon, making it twist and turn to try to smack them, and all the while they take small bites and swipes at its legs.\n\nJust as it looks like you'll get a return on your bet, a lucky strike knocks one of the dogs out cold and their confidence falters. After that, the demon takes them out one by one, beaten and bruised but still undefeated.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.b7e8332f-0620-4add-948a-7500d0604566;With flight, the griffon holds an advantage. The demon takes swipes at its underbelly as it swoops across the arena, but its speed and agility, its well trained landings and lift offs, are too much.\n\nFinally, the griffon lifts itself onto its back claws, screeching and scratching at the demon's face. The demon is beaten back into submission and the audience are enraptured, clapping and whistling loudly.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.974ef23e-1124-463f-a639-fdde07f05046;The moment weapons are drawn in anger, the crowd turns from engaged and excited to panic. They rush and run for the stairs, fleeing out into the street.\n\nThe demon looks to people from the audience who do not move so quickly. Who look at your interference and draw their own weapons.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.5541637a-36c6-41a1-8b03-88ea408dd744;With the enemy lying dead at your feet, the pit feels eerily quiet. A closer look reveals they are all wearing the sigil of Uram the Red, the Circle mage who you realise must be behind this entire affair.\n\nAfter a while the demon's labored breathing comes through to you.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.8d80e12b-3abd-4785-a4f5-3962596d33d6;Let's go.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.66a72298-8793-4cb6-b306-ac49c0dcdad7;You may live, if you join us.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.efba528b-edf6-4893-8689-5b1708a6bd0a;You make your way over to the demon, and it listens to your offer with a bored look. When you have finished, it waits an extra moment before flashing its teeth.\n\n"I'll fight for you," it says with a deep and low chuckle. It tilts is head towards the small crowd of shadowy figures who are watching you carefully, weapons ready. "If you can take care of them first."
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.903ade67-9deb-47b0-abaa-90675878abee;No problem at all. Attack!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.f823b187-693d-45f8-88cd-511386b549d3;Ah, well... Perhaps not then. Good night!
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.070af490-4a64-4821-9652-faddfe9d4246;The demon nods.\n\n"You are strong fighters," it states. "I would be happy to join you now that I am free of these wretches."
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.79f424e4-b08a-4c81-9f23-edcd24ff38dd;You are welcome.
#Uram Mid WP Underground Pit Fighting.e54a08fe-d25d-405f-bebb-ce0deac9ca3b;I'll pass. Don't let me see you again.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.0fc01bed-c498-44ee-a2d2-16dbffb70a48;You call a stop to your company as you hear the sound of wheels and hooves coming up behind you. Soldiers on horseback gallop up the trail, two of them drawing a tall cage up behind them. The demon inside thrashes around, violently trying to free itself. Seeing you passing by, it throws itself into the cage's mesh.\n\n"You! I will join you if you help me out of this prison! I am too powerful to be doomed to this fate!"
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.9df38632-0982-4640-a928-298104453968;Sorry. Looks like you are anyway.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.cf1ac77d-37dd-4c8e-b86d-70b864617f20;"No! I am Iztah, Third Underbaron to the Prince of the Fourth Quarter of the Ninth and Highest Level! Does that mean nothing to you here?! I command you release me!"\n\nThe demon continues to screech and rattle its cage as the troupe pass you and move out of reach.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.b56cd0cc-a0c4-48bc-ad52-44b2eefae863;I think we are alright to move on.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.a78b651a-7125-491e-81ce-81a05dcf638f;It's... It's just a simple lock.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.8f2be6d8-7efa-474f-93b6-8995bc1f1064;It is exceptionally easy to undo the lock of the cage with a simple manipulation spell, and the demon tumbles out of it as it continues on its way. It picks itself up and growls in the direction of the soldiers who, realising their prisoner is free, are turning around and preparing for an attack.\n\n"Thank you, mage!" the demon says. "Shall we slay these cretins together?!"
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.ace648a1-30f2-4946-8cc5-14e8976d8e13;They stand no chance against us.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.2cfd4189-f3fc-49f6-9dc4-aa981d784415;This isn't worth a fight. Good luck!
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.3e9a69f7-a1a3-49cc-bcf2-dd7c79fa131e;We will fight these forces without your aid, demon!
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.4965ed29-0439-4985-a7c4-2f954fa3282e;The demon's captors, all proudly wearing Uram the Red's sigil, laugh callously as they end your company's lifes.\n\nIn the chaos, the demon does try to escape, but some simple magic brings it to its knees again, and it gurgles to itself angrily as it is lifted back into the cage.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.f4b24415-3f68-4d92-a983-dda0320684c8;Curses.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.7ca7d593-390e-4150-a0a0-a4a623853091;Welcome to my ranks.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.11ea2cc4-8d61-49c4-847d-f2461f414e2a;Have fun spreading chaos, I guess.
#Uram Early WP Demon Prisoner.81ce9065-abff-45d2-8ce3-c771a815742e;The battle won, the demon rattles its cage one more time to remind you that it is still there. When finally free, it growls and stretches.\n\n"Magnificent!" it laughs. "I am Iztah, Third Underbaron to the Prince of the Fourth Quarter of the Ninth and Highest Level! As I have promised, I will serve you faithfully if you so wish, otherwise I will spread chaos and confusion across the waking world, as is tradition!"
#Uram Mid WP Demon Spawners.2ccbb693-59ec-4382-905a-fa1a2d7ce0fc;Multiple reports are reaching you of a gate to the realm of demons being opened not too far away.

Dark blood trails lead to an altar, of sorts, hastily set up using nearby boulders.\n\nYour eyes fall on a family, parents and childrens and the pack animal that must have pulled their vehicle. All have been killed with tremendous violence, the blood drying in a pool on one of the more central stones.

#Norimar Orcs Gossip 1.f728bdfe-7c39-469c-aced-267d9d62cd82;In the night you pass a camp where orcs sit around a fire. Their forms cast twitching shadows that look ghostly against the rough ground.\n\nSuddenly a plume of red rises from the fire and you hear their shaman chanting. Their rhythmic voice becomes louder and louder until you understand fractions of what they are saying.\n\n"… impending doom… rising evil… rise… bring carnage to all of Eo!"

He fled this way when we fought back and we will not give up until he is dead."\n\nThe one bleeding from their head is missing an ear. He begrudgingly turns to ask you: "Are you not a mage yourself? You could destroy them too, could you not? We have lots to trade for such a favor..."
#Norimar Undead Slaughtered 1_2.3bd0622f-15f7-442d-bdee-8ebdca9f812e;We saw your ear on our way. My apologies.
#Norimar Undead Slaughtered 1_3.2573793c-30fe-4a5a-a292-11c021b20078;After cleansing the once fortified settlement of the remaining undead, you take a look around. Pieces of decaying flesh and broken bones lie amid corpses of merchants and wanderers and destroyed tents. The eerie silence only adds to the picture of hopelessness.
#Norimar Undead Slaughtered 1_4.57998e65-4e9a-4bd0-96b6-bde0bf888f66;The acolyte backs away, smiling maniacally.\n\n"No matter what you do, I will just be raised again! My duty is only fulfilled when the Revenants return."\n\nA mad laugh bubbles forth and the man draws a ritual dagger. With a swift movement, he slashes his own throat and tumbles to the ground, eyes watering as his cackling chokes into a grim death.
#Norimar Undead Slaughtered 1_4.136e3a0f-83ea-476d-ac7e-56be3e6e1042;He was beyond saving. But what is this about Revenants?

#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds Intro.9961a447-6a71-4cc0-bb7e-44552a60200a;Your march has brought you to a small town. Wandering through the streets, you notice a lack of any real market selling new or fresh goods. On enquiry, the occupants tell you that trade with a local village where many supplies are bought and sold has dried up with no word or messenger of what happened.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds Intro.f057e363-5b48-4a1b-b396-aee880d0fb0e;Perhaps we can look into it.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.01e07fe9-3022-499b-8420-b26a9d64ed45;Nestled away in the countryside, the hamlet is very isolated. As such, it isn't the quiet that surprises you, but the distinct smell of rot and ruin that meets you before you see it.\n\nWhen you lay eyes on the place, the devastation is apparent. A number of bodies look to have been dragged and roped up on an altar by the village gate, but others are simply strewn about. Movement in the village brings your attention to demons meandering about, as well as footsoldiers.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.16dc9014-132c-4f4f-9acb-08b9eb8c2498;Let's see what happened here.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.722d1a12-5451-48eb-933e-a43ad1a32208;You approach the village cautiously, as not to spook the demons into an immediate attack. They notice your arrival, but seem to glance around at the footsoldiers before taking action. In turn, one of the footsoldiers disappears and reappears behind a red robed mage.\n\n"You are interrupting important research of Uram of the Circle," he calls to you and your soldiers. "What do you want?"
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.54cfcac6-66a1-4e53-af15-09475ca640de;You call this massacre research?
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.ce7000b8-0b71-4ad6-9b39-410d6fa79a77;We have come to end this madness.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.8a380198-4572-4889-ae7a-90d29311eee2;I have come to aid Uram in his work.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.d2f84842-d3f5-4a3a-afc8-b51c953e0a38;"Those at the altar were willingly sacrificed!" the mage shouts. "Others changed their minds when they saw what the sacrifice meant, and for that they were punished. Now we watch to see whether demons can remain here once the gates are closed."\n\nAs if amused by the very idea that it is a scientific experiment, one of the demons chuckles softly.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.9feee066-3492-48da-adc1-0616039e93f2;Then we must put an end to this.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.35774277-bba6-4bfa-bec8-ec417ac078c4;How may I aid Uram in his work?
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.8d54c89f-370a-4b1d-8ea9-37296a3abb47;The mage eyes you suspiciously for a few moments before walking away. Minutes later he returns with a grim smile.\n\n"There is another place like this not far away. If you can attempt there what we are attempting here, Uram will be most grateful."
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.6c303df2-12f8-4a6b-a9cc-d001ec083944;That is a true test.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.3b6a4455-a3cd-4784-a71f-c2ace9de535d;After a difficult fight, your band of fighters stands victorious. It will be some time before this hamlet sees any life again, you think, but eventually it may return.\n\nA rider from the town comes to meet your company later in the day, thanking you for your effort and repaying it in kind.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.042b7d50-7014-4231-aaf6-1a6f63b0cea5;The demons revel in the fight and enjoy every moment of their victory. The mage too seems pleased with his research results, leaving you to go back to your tower with much to think about.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.04f06e8e-c8d4-4909-8023-465f46426fba;This is but one defeat.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.8a431b7c-0ceb-4a3d-9444-3d74c90c2336;The near unnatural quiet and the smell of rot and ruin warn you of disaster in this small hamlet before you lay eyes on the devastation.\n\nBodies have been left strewn about, or piled on an altar near the hamlet gate. Demons roam around freely. If you were to guess, you might say they were a remnant of Uram's forces in the area.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.a2894251-47c7-4e34-b555-ea6e39ff7940;Then they are no threat anymore.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.f09428c5-8f8e-41d5-a2a5-738a5750b72a;The demons destroyed, you look around the hamlet to see if anything can be salvaged. Very little, as it turns out. They have truly ruined this place.\n\nSome time later though, a rider from the town comes to assess the damage for themselves. They reward you for your service and begin talking of grand plans to make the hamlet a memorial to those who were slain.
Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.88ee0a90-c60c-49e9-a718-5225a3aece4b;All in a day's work.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds.94f1d373-57e7-4ca8-8dde-7a0f628c9be1;Your force is no match for the demons, falling before their blades and claws in fear and hopelessness.

#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.1688525c-419e-470f-8dbd-750fa8feb4e9;The villagers' expressions all turn to confusion.\n\n"What are you chattering about?!" one of them asks. "We've no reason to be afeared. This is our home! And we hold no grudge with no one, let alone these... Circle mages, whoever they are."
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.88107037-fd5f-49db-96b5-e1f5f019d11a;You must leave now.

#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.67e0c0b5-4b8b-45d2-abb7-5e4368de8eaf;Under your spell, the people obediently begin to pack up their things and hurry away. By nightfall, the small village is deathly quiet. Uram, you know, was expecting another new portal to the demon realms, or at least an attempt. There will be consequences for your decisions.
Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.d0366c4e-b3d6-42ae-b75c-7ceda68d4f56;So be it.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.85c82436-8412-4b24-9614-64c8a3b49271;It is truly a massacre. With the hamlet fresh in your memory, you have a similar altar constructed. Uram's apprentice mage follows in the evening to perform the rituals, opening another new gate to the demon realms.\n\nA fair few demons come through into Fiara, and as additional thanks for your aid, the mage tells you you may take some for yourself, if you so wish.
#Uram Mid WP Sacrificial Grounds 2.e213231b-32aa-444e-8474-3066ea1ffe73;I will take them under my command.

Even the sun is blotted out by the shadow that billows into the room.\n\n"One warning was more than you deserved." A cold, steady voice freezes the blood in your veins. "Prepare yourself, for what little it will do you. There is no defense against the true might of real magic."

#Hokan Early WP Mass Grave.1a163477-7b1a-4cba-91f3-34226a682751;The distinctly dark magic in the air lends easy explanation to the massive pit that has been dug in the center of the place, deep into the earth as if to fit dozens of bodies.\n\nBut, wherever they have gone, the pit is empty now. Somewhere, close by the strength of the magical footprint, a horde of the Undead probably roam.

Not long later, you come to a fork in the road that leads to a tiny village barely worth the title.
Hokan Early WP Mass Grave.4126355e-6fe8-451c-895d-a96d1f7dfc1f;Let's see what we can find.
#Hokan Early WP Mass Grave.a3c56d69-bfda-4d48-bac8-a185191f004c;Slowly, cautiously, marching into the village, the smell and the magical energies in the air only become heavier and heavier. The village center has been dug up into a massive pit in which countless bodies lie. Parents, children, elders. Their killers were non-discriminate.\n\nAll who look upon that sight feel a great deal of dread and lethargy. But they are not undead and you are in no immediate danger.
#Hokan Early WP Mass Grave.bdf14951-304a-4755-80ce-b38958a23205;You are already in village bounds when you hear moaning and howling start to ring out across the small space.\n\nA giant pit has been dug in the village square, into which a number of bodies have been thrown. The magic has done its work and they are once again awake as undead creatures, pulling themselves back out of the pit towards you.
#Hokan Early WP Mass Grave.2250df2b-7793-45f6-9d8f-5349a5f85eee;The village is in good condition. It doesn't look as though there was a fight or an attempt to flee. In fact, in a couple of the houses, you find a now rotten meal left at the table, as if the occupants simply walked away during dinner.\n\nThe strange occurance leaves you with a decent haul from this tiny place.
#Hokan Early WP Shaikan.5e9c3a69-52a5-4f1a-9efd-a71a48d0ab9e;You happen upon a camp whose occupants are quietly chatting while cooking an animal on a makeshift spit across their fire. Each of them bears the telltale tattoos of the Shaikan and when they see you, their hands move to their weapons.

The small group take their own quiet and council before she turns back to you.\n\n"In exchange for these safe paths, we will teach you some of what we know about fighting," she says.\n\nEven your most seasoned soldiers struggle with the Shaikan training regime but the entire company learns a lot.

#Hokan Early WP Shaikan.628d5503-be5c-472f-a56d-1a1366b8fa4e;Two things strike you as odd. That undead are roaming unchecked across the Highmark, and that they are chasing a group of Shaikan.

They fight among a small hoard of undead creatures and some mages too.\n\nTheir opponents can only be Shaikan, by the speed and ferocity with which they are darting between their foes, cutting and slashing in whirlwhind strikes. They are outnumbered though, and even as you watch they seem to be calling the retreat.

Your troops shift nervously, glancing at you for direction. "I didn't think so," Elynn spits. "We help them, or we walk away. There is no third option."
#Hokan Mid WP Shaikan Camp.48e72962-e12c-446d-bfb4-eebc30503f30;The Shaikan, exhausted and heavily injured, barely manage to make it to you before collapsing at your feet, breathing hard.\n\n"Thank you," one of them says.

#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.06b78a6c-aa4a-477a-9ed4-bb20fb260b94;Passing through this place it is clear that the residents are worried and confused, standing about the altar to Hirin that marks the entrance to their graveyard with dark expressions.\n\n"All our dead have gone," one man tells you as you enquire. "Yesterday, these graves were full. Now they're all empty. It makes no sense!"
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.8156672b-847a-4ade-9a0a-37e0e963265f;This is none of our concern. Move on.

#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.1fac6542-6fc5-4318-837d-743914d66b62;Some of the graves here are obviously very old but as the villager told you, all have very recently been dug up. It looks as though the earth was moved from underneath, and from some you see long claw marks dragging away from the graves.\n\nThe tracks are quickly swallowed by the mud and earth - making them difficult to follow. But perhaps there is another solution to the predicament.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.62ef527a-635e-40b0-a30e-554b14ca7dcd;Our creatures have a better chance at finding the trail.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.a8480ec0-3e9a-4854-a4c0-6f0660a15b10;Maybe the graveyard worker saw something.

Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.4c541e84-9b1a-429a-829a-724b822ff8ea;I suppose we will be on our way then.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.6014fad2-4242-436b-82aa-ba0880d5570f;Using magic of the school of death makes it easy to pick out the traces the undead have left behind them. They have marched eastwards, at least initially, but with your newly found trail you can follow them wherever they have gone.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.5fdeee37-5b39-42ea-8b7a-23d48db0c334;You point the creatures of your company towards the scratches and claw marks, giving them enough time to pick up the undead scent that is beyond the rest of your noses. Sure enough, the creatures can hunt the trail down, leading you after the village's dead.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.2c637511-ee42-4119-bfbb-f51e1af578b9;Try as they might, it seems the trail has grown too cold even for the creatures of your company to follow. The mystery of this village's walking dead will likely remain so, for now.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.71473cd5-c419-4c03-8c37-88d6c8b79ac1;The worker is an old woman in a bundle of heavy wraps and shawls, sat in a hut at the other end of the graveyard. Even as you step into the dark and dusty room to speak to her, you hear her muttering to herself.\n\n"Dead things. Dead things everywhere. Middle of the night. Muttering. From the village. Sunwards. Muttering. Dead things. In the water."\n\nShe must have got quite the shock.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.fdf649ad-255b-4cd2-a38d-5d1d68449fca;In the water. Is there a river around?
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.c5ee1ac3-350d-4e3b-b4a5-b153c4abdc70;From the village? Check that way for tracks.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.fcff0481-5e60-4488-8242-f3184b37b4df;Sunwards? Perhaps they went east.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.1616bd56-7024-4fa2-ac77-77f756ae904e;Some of the villagers help you try to find the trail, desperate to find their loved ones' bodies, but to no avail. The trail, if there even is one, has disappeared, and with no idea what else the old graveyard worker could have meant, the mystery cannot be unravelled.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.e0e42b50-4e86-4d1e-afbb-cddbf660ce32;The villagers lead you to a small stream. You do not expect to find tracks in the water, of course, but perhaps on the other side of it?\n\nAlas, once you have managed to cross the stream, there is no trail to be found, and with a whole morning now behind you, it is not likely to be found elsewhere either.
#Hokan Mid WP Dead Investigation.f15149bf-cc55-46b6-b155-fe57814c5ca0;You leave the village behind you, the whole company trekking eastwards to pick up the trail.\n\nJust as you are about to give up hope, you find the same unmistakable clawmarks in the dryer earth. One of the undead may have slipped or fallen, only to continue dragging itself along its involentary path.\n\nThe hunt is on!

#Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3.bf8ee5a0-afaa-431e-b542-9ffc145ad19c;You are torn from your sleep by the sudden, nauseating feeling of falling. Just as you think you might hit the ground, your eyes open and you find yourself in a shadowy chamber. Everywhere you look are spikes and chains, but your attention is caught by Hokan Ashir, pacing around with his hands clasped tightly.\n\n"One of my fellow Circle mages, Uram the Red, has become corrupted by the Allfire," he tells you before you can orient yourself. "He is plotting against us all. If you do not wish us to fall to his machinations, you will stop his forces before it is too late."

"Do you not think I recognize the signs?! He has become corrupted because he is a weak-minded fool. Or has he already drawn you into his schemes, hm? Are you a traitor, like him?"

Hokan says. "Away with you. I see I can only depend on myself. I will deal with Uram in my way."\nFreezing cold comes over you, then searing heat. You sit up in your bed, dripping sweat.
#Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3.1e04611c-a315-4713-9cda-fa5f4d91de07;"He has taken to consorting with demons!" Hokan growls. "Not only is it dangerous for us all, it is foolish. The undead have no mind of their own, controlling them is trivial. Signing unknowable pacts with creatures who have a mind of their own... We can only hope he gets himself killed before he kills the rest of us!"

Go there and stop him!"\n\nA moment later you shoot up from your own bed, disoriented again. You know the surprise meeting was real when you suddenly remember the location of the village where Hokan suspects Uram is operating.

#Tuscari Sea Gossip 1.791d5c3d-898c-41b2-9442-b17ebad9e804;Trudging along the muddy shores of the Tuscari Sea, you meet a sole fisherman furiously lasting out at one looks like over-sized frogspawn.\n\n"Blasted creatures! Take this!"
#Tuscari Sea Gossip 1.f545ee7c-1523-42ba-9053-d4d7bc3c9209;What are you doing?
#Tuscari Sea Gossip 1.b654ae87-0937-410c-946f-2c17cc165400;Goo oozes out to coat the ground and fill the water as you squash as many of the eggs as you can. The fisherman is taking great pleasure in the display of violence, watching you with a grin.\n\n"Thank you. That is the revenge my poor kitty deserves. You hear me?! No jelly eats my kitty without getting killed!"\n\nHe sounds at the water. A ripple goes through it and you hear distant plashing.
#Tuscari Sea Gossip 1.42d671f8-ee30-4de7-a054-e6a5dcecb5d9;"These are jelly eggs. Hungry, awful beasts. They ate my cat! I want all the revenge I can get on them. There are far too many anyways!"

#Tuscari Sea Portal.6377feed-d073-4d77-b76a-c19a3c350511;You find yourself before a large stone arch. It is overgrown with moss and algae, filling every tear and crevice in the uneven surface. The glyphs and symbols carved into it mark it as a portal, but where to you cannot discern.\n\nIt takes no great wisdom to see the portal is old and has been inactive for a while. Yet, you still feel a faint magic emanating from it.
#Tuscari Sea Portal.6414aa4b-939e-40c9-b1d6-e82f2836849d;Maybe I can unlock it with the right ingredients?
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.f51e0428-f36c-4195-bd02-c5c76f9fd825;The medusa looks you over and a sudden recognition flashes over her face. Her features soften ever so slightly as her hands drop back down.\n\n"You are them, yes? The mage’s apprentice? I recognize the flute you carry. That means the Circle got to him after all..."
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.68635626-bcf4-49de-8046-e411338aabfc;You knew my master?
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.34ce7e3b-cdac-472f-9dad-1d504bd676da;It belonged to my master. Did you know him?
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.264a76e1-0f61-4cbc-84d2-945a558750cd;"It is a bridge between Fiara and what you know as the Unknown Islands. Unfortunately its power was cut off and I cannot return home."
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.ee471451-6b7a-4708-b002-635b5e5cfd38;Her features turn dark. You can see barely restrained anger bubbling up under the surface of her eyes.\n\n"Shâr is a monster. He used the portal to gather my kind and enslave them. He has even gifted them to the other Circle members, as if we were simply cattle."\n\nShe spits out in disgust.
#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.7cd235cd-3239-49a7-a837-2a7550b467c7;She takes a deep breath, as to steel herself.\n\n"Your master was not just researching this portal, but also the Allfire and how to tame it. We spoke of it at length. He was very curious about my magic as well and… but I get sidetracked.\n\nShâr and the others never liked people knowing much about the Allfire. An army would have been the least to prepare against them."
Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.c87b6d6e-e227-4897-a143-5655db312f70;What portal?

Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.9918e0d9-0db5-411c-8e67-bf1de6999fc1;Why would my master need your army?
Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.267e7e0f-3625-444b-9e69-f7d6dc97202d;I could be the one to fulfill that promise.

#Tuscari Sea Jelly 2.eeac166e-57b4-4bb2-a592-aac0accf5cb7;With a fluid motion the medusa bows and the jellies around her mimic the movement.\n\n"Then we may help each other. My sister and I took your master’s things to safety. Unfortunately, she was recently attacked by a wyvern. If we can find this beast, we can surely discover how to open the portal within your master’s reports.\n\nOnce this is done, the army I promised your master shall be yours to command."
#T_ResearchCrystalLocation.1749b60d-423a-43ea-bd55-80efe6d6e049;Indeed, there was a rumor of a necromancer some time ago who called forth a group of shadow-creatures from the Magnet Stones to retrieve one of the floating crystal shards for him.\n\nIt could be worth seeking him out to learn the process.

#T_CrystalDestination.c6f26384-f62a-4591-ba9b-a469e8654b08;Could it really be that simple?
#T_CrystalDestination.749e3ee7-860a-4eb0-9936-ae0ec39614ca;The necromancer’s corpse dealt with too, you are finally able to approach the stone. Its black, obsidian surface emanates a soft light, which slowly grows and wanes.\n\nBehind you, your troops await your command.

All of them blink in confusion, utterly incapable of making a move. At the same time, a black light engulfs them and some begin to lose substance.

Tuscari Sea Masters Reports 1.6c76ce52-e6d9-4a46-906d-b0de3632dbe9;The satchel only contains a quarter of a page, edges torn as if the paper was ripped apart. It is crinkled for good measure.\n\nFlattening it out, you make out: 'Learning about the portal… A dagger rubbed in the ashes of fallen warriors should provide a good base...'
Tuscari Sea Masters Reports 1.649fd138-58ec-43aa-a7bb-d3cd704a9f64;Interesting indeed. Onwards.

#Tuscari Sea Masters Reports 3.e970bbcf-b75f-4392-a095-08569435dfbd;So bark is not one of the ingredients I need.

Tuscari Sea Portal.d7e70023-7cf7-4b4a-8487-e1386f7446d7;You prepare the ritual, combining the ingredients and infusing each with magic. Your spell weaves around the portal and you can feel its power spark to life.\n\nSuddenly the ground beneath your feet trembles and the magic dissolves, leaving a faint stench of burnt hair and coals in your mouth.
Tuscari Sea Portal.108dd137-60a6-43cb-9c04-0dfc14d6279b;That didn't work. I will have to try again.
#Tuscari Sea Portal.eca83203-968e-4392-a9c2-7a60f11f41f9;The ritual takes hold. You feel a strong surge pull you towards the portal. Loud cracking, like thunder, and flashes fill the area around it and magic starts swirling into life at its center.\n\nWith a final pulse, the portal manifests beneath the stone arch. The strange smells of a jungle waft through it.
#Tuscari Sea Portal.1c4c330b-5f70-4a10-98d4-2e8ecb33b727;It seems the restoration was successful.
#Tuscari Sea Portal.12cf2f05-62f7-43ba-bd43-e7e03dce8c72;A medusa emerges from the water and approaches the portal. She has many wounds. She passes through the portal and disappears.\n\nLater she returns, followed by more of her kind.\n\n"We are ready to fight, master mage. At your command."

#Tuscari Sea Masters Reports 2.c00d1860-8029-4c52-9afe-818ea8830eb9;A small group breaks away and starts making as much noise as they can. They splash in the waters and shout and the wyvern quickly swoops down to chase away the threat.
#Tuscari Sea Masters Reports 2.42feb9f3-7e80-4b68-8ca2-2fe9b88a7955;Within the hour, the wyvern takes flight, probably to find food, leaving the nest unattended. It is undeniably a stroke of luck, but you take it nonetheless.

#Misty Coast Orgash Rumor 1.9dced570-3623-4836-a0f7-ef8729ef0ea4;You come across a small band of orc travelers bundled up against the salty wind, carrying their lives on their backs and struggling to push a cart full of stone chunks.

It is only when they are a little closer that you see not everyone in the group is a Westguard soldier. As they move north, they are pushing orc prisoners along with them.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.090cbcff-4b73-4d31-a800-d183742f3648;Slowly coming up behind you, you hear the sound of many marching feet. When a voice cries out, you take a moment to look.\n\nA band of soldiers from the Westguard are dragging some orc prisoners north. They will be upon you shortly.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.693295d9-7c3d-4e35-b443-e524519ad5fb;Your company is breaking camp after a short rest when a scout returns in an enthusiastic hurry to give his report.\n\n"There are soldiers nearby bearing the Stormes' standard - from the Westguard! They are taking orcish prisoners north!"
Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.3c1e5563-3cba-4d90-8b4a-7a2606264773;Perhaps I can talk the soldiers into sense.
Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.b52864c7-8c1b-4baf-ba92-9bedfb92508f;Wait. Not all of these orcs will be raiders.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.6ff70159-1369-428f-9c0a-a7089c3f2295;This has nothing to do with us. Move on.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.3845db67-12b4-48db-9e11-ac4f137ee98f;Let's go. This is not our fight.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.0bd15bee-9691-408c-a5e2-86e3bdd88782;We should not get involved. Let's go.

#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.b033f800-812f-4348-8774-4b9553fc2bc1;Lytra spurs her horse to meet the soldiers before they reach you in force. It is quite obvious that she is trying everything she can to make them see they cannot follow their orders blindly, but whether out of fear or steadfast belief, they will not listen.\n\nAs Lytra rides back to you, despondent, the soldiers order the prisoners away at a quicker pace, away from you and the Storme of questionable loyalty to the Westguard.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.23f380bc-a33a-444c-b2e6-e9d7a2b76355;Perhaps next time, Lytra.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.bcbc5007-be06-47eb-af56-fd61af812266;It is obvious that the soldiers recognize Lytra as the Lady of Stormwatch Faste. One even bends the knee.\n\nLytra engages them in a long discussion, quite openly in front of the orc prisoners. Those who understand her nod along enthusiastically and after some time, the soldiers' minds are changed. They set about releasing the orcs from their bonds before continuing their long march north.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.bc1c5a63-eefa-4934-bbef-0df0ec88d321;Well worked, Lytra!
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.38cf477e-11cf-4be9-b7f0-48c94e4f2d24;Of course you have some numbers to fight the Westguard soldiers if you must, but the right spell may also free the prisoners without the Stormes, or anyone else, learning of your involvement.

#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.73f5769a-a2a0-4cc0-b1ab-83b2a49df670;The moment the orcs realise they are free, chaos ensues.\n\nSome choose to fight, taking the soldiers by surprise long enough for the rest to run. The fight turns into a brawl that leaves many on both sides greviously wounded or dead. The orcs that escape all turn and flee southwards, back into the stretches of the Misty Coast.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.2681743a-5fe0-47df-8ba6-9911dcdb5921;My work here is done.
#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.59b8b12f-efc9-489d-a0ca-ce2d481fbc1b;The orcs get to work freeing themselves from their bonds while you focus your efforts on their guard.\n\nWhen they are free, some of the leaner, more ragged members of the group offer you their service in return for steady pay.

#Misty Coast Orc Prisoners.fedadf26-0ca2-4804-83c9-a8bfd84f6cf5;Bold and resolute as they have always been in the Westguard, these soldiers prove too strong for your troops, pushing back your attack with no doubt that they can also stop the prisoners from escaping.

Alluvyan City Sickness 1.a0dc505f-ca5b-4b3a-9d35-8a437afb94b1;With some observation, you conclude the group has been poisoned. It is nothing fatal – with some bed rest, none of them will suffer any long-lasting effects.\n\nAfter a few hours in your care, their condition finally starts to improve. You are certain that, the next morning, all of them will be as good as new.
Alluvyan City Sickness 1.05c74b4c-823e-419f-a053-d078803bfc37;That was easy. I wonder who did it...
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.113f7dd5-ee34-4c6c-a1e4-6a406ec80271;Between a few trees, you see the theater group you helped heal not but a few days ago.

She wasn’t happy with how we portrayed her race in our latest piece so she joined us for a meal and poisoned us!"\n\n"You made us act like headless chickens!

#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.719efbfa-e184-470c-99d0-038d2bb806a1;Poisoning seems a bit drastic.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.1dfa7d12-ccb9-4351-83ea-ff772f5ef24d;The elf takes up position close to you as the theater group sneers.\n\n"Oh, what do you know? They’ve done enough over the years to warrant our anger. Stealing our lenya, driving us from the woods… It’s about time someone stood up to them!"
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.1b0849ef-69b0-4436-b3d2-5b76e1e07a42;Find your manners, or I’ll lose mine.

#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.f2f5140b-775f-4f5b-9034-7e053eb0fc90;You are right. The elf should be punished.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.146307a1-069d-49be-9f62-83eac514722e;You acted out and will be punished for it.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.4d6eb479-b5b2-4e3c-8c7e-4cdfca4474ec;The elf is right. You got what you deserved.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.36b417b7-8477-4a7b-9a63-af7c02aa6dde;Some of the troupe go to speak up but, eyeing your seasoned soldiers, decide against it.

#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.1dc7dff9-892f-4c39-bd2b-3d5d0111751e;Indeed you can. Join me.

#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.b02affdf-64f2-431e-b10e-aaeb762fb275;The troupe sneer and chuckle as they circle the elf. She barely as much as blinks as she is restrained.\n\n"What will we do with her?"
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.8d6aa623-cf3b-4f7c-9128-ad9d15a0a2b1;Take her to the militia. Prison will do her good.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.6ac59e3d-fc58-470e-b5c1-0c8e5794b9e4;She should pay for her freedom.

#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.5a84c86f-5dba-4fd8-bde6-eb02e11caf05;As you turn to leave, the elf utters a sharp cry in her own language. Too late, you feel the tendrils of a curse take hold.\n\nShe is resolute up until the moment she dies. The troupe run away more afraid than satisfied, no doubt also feeling the curse’s effects.
#Alluvyan City Sickness 3.97795487-96c8-4234-a2c7-fd37562bd8a8;This did not go as I expected...
#Misty Coast Skirmish.cc766db2-efce-48e4-83e9-94260239d85a;You hear the sounds of fighting from a little way off and hurriedly send a scout to find the cause of the commotion. She returns a few moments later, breathing heavily.\n\n"It is soldiers from the Westguard, great mage!" she reports. "They are engaged with a smaller force of orcs. It looks like they are guerrilla fighters of some kind."\n\nIntervening in the fight could raise your standing, either with the Westguard or the local fighters.

Clusters of spider eggs are stuck to the walls and nearby trees. From within the abode you can hear whimpers and groans but also the chittering of many legged creatures.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.1fedd90a-4656-4f3d-b2e9-d288112a6c88;Slice up those eggs!
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.c9db6743-b936-4d13-9e25-139d4f406c72;I will dissolve the webs on the ground.

#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.940779fa-f71c-4ff9-8b70-a6a04b4c9f53;You walk around with your troops, making sure they do not miss any eggs. A few of them do show strange markings and colorations, hinting at mutations. \n\nAs you take care of a small spider shooting icy cold webs, you begin to hear a loud clicking. The parents have been alerted by the sounds of their dying brood.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.865b5fc1-a557-4e74-9e54-1ddcc5dbb380;You clear the way to the hut with a few drops here and there that quickly disintegrate the webs and soon stand before the door. From within you can still hear the strange noises.

#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.dbcf43d6-95ef-4d1d-93cd-5f2135099168;City of the Orcs
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.13b9f8df-9a42-4f75-af63-16321fd4a1ed;The moment you stepped into this city, which you don't remember seeing on any maps, you could tell it was not like the cities of the Highmark. At first, from the rubble that lies strewn about, you think that it has been destroyed, but you soon realise it is construction work.\n\nThere are orcs all about, clearing pathways and marking roads, using the rubble to build houses and what looks like a tavern. You have never heard of orcs... laying down roots like this.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.c8f83c90-8822-4603-ae80-4862138c37b0;Perhaps I should take a look around.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.ec24c29f-a167-4495-9500-bd5118337210;With all the orcs preoccupied, you quietly tell a member of your company to collect what has caught your eye. As you suspected, you feel a thrum of magic as it is brought closer to you. How anyone let this be thrown casually away is beyond you.\n\n"Are you a mage then?"\n\nA rough voice behind you makes you spin around. Two orcs, one man and one woman, have clambered down off the wall and now face you, wearing suspicious expressions. When you signal for the artifact to be laid down, the man waves a hand.\n\n"Keep it,” he says. “We have higher priorities right now.”
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.f097ae24-59ad-4718-80a7-bb06a1d00e8c;My thanks. Are you in charge here?
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.c3ce6276-4f59-462d-aa34-f6891650838b;You find yourself in a quiet corner of the city. Here, orcs are working on the outer walls. Or wall, as only a section of it has been built over ten feet. Further along, it looks like the builders are still discussing how best to build a strong foundation.\n\nAnd as you look around, you see a pile of tools and weapons just left on the street. One of the items in the pile stands out to you as more ornate, though no newer, than the rest of it.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.fb6a6f26-2667-43e5-bbf6-6ce5f7213e6e;Investigate the possible artifact.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.4b88a139-f752-4f50-8176-6160922f9401;I shall shape the earth to help lay the wall foundation.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.02e9f1d8-f93f-42d7-ad3e-f8325c9359f6;Who is in charge here?
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.30263cae-e993-443a-8d82-4aaccb63dd14;"Then why bring it here?" Gruun asks with venom in her voice. Toraq laughs.\n\n"She is not wrong to ask," he says. "The Westguard has looked to push us from our homes for many years. It would not be the first time they have sent some stranger to attempt what they have failed. But if not that, why are you here?"
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.2a479465-29ec-4794-9d4c-ab06aa891dcc;To trade. Hire troops. Provide help, if I can.
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.5796f383-f97c-4e65-bdff-7210dbfbf856;"It is a rare thing, I'll give you that." Toraq chuckles. His expression turns stoney as he takes you in properly.\n\n"Dark tidings come from the east," he says. "They say the rivers of the Howling Steppes run red with blood. That it seeps from the Needle's stones. Calamity is coming and we must be ready for it." He raises his arms to indicate the city around him. "This is being ready. But... why are you here?"
Misty Coast City of the Orcs.8d50d365-7d86-4c30-8556-6fba786bb7d8;"We are a young clan," Gruun says with a hint of spite. "Formed to make this marvel around you. You are not expected to have heard of us."\n\nToraq laughs.\n\n"Trust is not easy for us," he states. "We have been fighting the Westguard to defend this place for ourselves since before the Stoneheavers united. If you are not with them, mage, and not with us, why are you here?"
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.cad4cd81-3b8d-48e6-b5b3-f1316ea144bb;When you find Toraq and Gruun, they are attempting to set a big, metal gate into a gap in the wall, carrying it precariously between them. When he sees you, Toraq smirks but does not stop his work.\n\n"Word has reached us that you've been continuing to give your aid to the Misty Coast! You have my thanks, but the work is not done. There are... a couple of things you might help us with... if you can spare the time."
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.001c59ce-fe64-413c-9c63-d8da60678153;What do you need?
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.170b61f1-45c0-4d95-b202-afbd3e6a4fbd;"Soldiers from the Westguard and their ridiculous allies still roam these lands freely," Gruun says as she bends at the waist and then heaves upwards to shove the gate into position. Both she and Toraq relax then, breathing heavily.\n\n"They have set up camps that must be torn down, and stolen resources meant to help build Orgash," she continues. "Small tasks. Perhaps easy for you?"
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.504eaf72-c0d8-441b-8d9b-027945c145c1;Easy enough.
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.76ff2702-f18b-4b5e-8dfb-012f63bca9f3;Toraq looks at you for a moment before nodding and looking around at the work going on around him.\n\n"We have riders," he says out of the blue. "When our fighters find these camps or our stolen resources, they will send someone to your tower to inform you. Do not worry about telling us where it is. We will find it. And... well, you are a mage. In thanks for your work, should you come across any magical items or supplies, you are free to keep them. We can make them anew, when the time is right."
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.1cd792e2-6236-4218-96c6-a9e0f33aa41e;That is most generous of you. We will get going.
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.62b21406-f248-47e8-ad91-fc990c77950a;Gruun laughs loudly as she paints paste across another stone, and Toraq's expression shows toothy amusement. When he realises you are being serious, he looks a little crestfallen.\n\n"I will believe it when I see it," he says. "Humans of the Storme clan still run rampant across these lands, claiming we pillage and burn and steal when all we do is protect our home and take back what they stole from us. And now they have allies, this so-called New Purity, that hunt our shamans too. While they are here, there is little else we can do that we do not already."
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.48b6f991-92d0-4d0a-85a9-97b00ce7f8a9;Then perhaps we can help thin their numbers.
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.a87c72ae-30d2-431a-85a2-9084a7493130;Toraq eyes you suspiciously, smirking again. Looking around at his city, he nods and scratches a cheek.\n\n"Very well," he nods. "You are a mage - you must have a tower. I will send riders to find you when we locate their camps or the resources they have stolen from us, that were meant to help build this city. And in thanks, if you find anything of magical value, you may keep it. We have other priorities right now."
#Misty Coast City of the Orcs.b7b6ac85-ce05-402e-9f52-da3b86e28170;We have a deal. All the best with your building.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.9eb3df7f-ee53-4d67-8662-828be590e295;Stepping inside you are instantly taken aback by what lays before you. An elderly man, almost completely engulfed in webs and with six spiderlegs coming from his back. His eyes are turned upwards so only the white is visible and he groans, twitches and mumbles constantly. \n\nHis hands grip a large glyph that pulses occasionally and with each pulse you can see spider eggs growing on or around the man.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.356b2738-0728-4256-b17a-dd294e0025b6;Rip that thing from him!
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.19954772-a1bc-49bf-8912-0e873d5cd706;Kill him before these spiders hatch!
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.fdfd6f15-8575-436f-9813-4a1b092161e7;I think I can break this curse.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.18931fa6-fe24-4f95-a392-56ad8734947b;A shockwave goes through everything as soon as the glyph leaves the mans hands. As if a hot knife was passing though everything, the webs and eggs around begin to crumble while he falls to the ground lifeless, his body was already too weak.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.faaf9810-3a80-4051-83f0-32a8e0c2f26a;You return the news to Connach. The people react with a mixture of shock and appall, but mostly they are relieved that it is all over now.\n\n"Thank you, master mage. That was quite a remarkable feat."
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.1451c131-adc8-4505-8d01-20316d0c6579;Let's hope we killed all of those beasts.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.44cfea18-24a9-4612-830a-4703eb9a6c6e;Looking around the hut you find notes and records of his doings. Apparently he was trying to find a way to domesticate the spiders but the spell went horribly wrong.
Southwatch City Spider 1_2.01c5a8a2-f723-48f8-a2e4-f82ee128cca0;Search the hut, I wanna know what happened.
Southwatch City Spider 1_2.21ab11eb-a50d-4375-8ea8-55ae8ad51c3d;Let us tell the people of these findings.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.491b3999-2afd-4882-ba8f-06041c32c348;With a single blow the man topples over as all life leaves his body. The glyph tumbles to the ground and an eery silence begins to spread. You realize that the eggs all around you have stopped moving.
#Southwatch City Spider 1_2.1de07c30-e6df-4373-8ee1-52b4e3646664;The man falls to the ground with a shudder. After a moment he opens his eyes and croaks weakly: "Thank you." He cannot bring up the strength to add more but after a while he begins to point towards a floor board. \nHidden underneath you find a true treasure trove for arcanists. The man nods shortly for you to take it all before falling into a deep slumber.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2.17e99acc-4633-46a7-a9c6-c96200715527;The people in Connach are fearful, for large spiders - some mutated and strange - have cocooned one of their wells right at the outskirts of the city.\n\n"Their webs are everywhere, clogging our water supplies and sewers. A few days more and we might just have no water - and streets full of, well, you know. Can you help us?"
#Southwatch City Spiders 2.8fbf2382-6d88-40e5-ac89-3420da007324;Of course. We will be quick.

#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.2073f120-3b61-4719-a9b1-a8d8e6fa5f48;You can see a white hill, completely covered in webs. The only indication that this is a well is a shingled roof atop that barely raises over the masses of webs and... eggs!\n\nA variety of eggs, some with strange markings, are laid out around the well. A few have aready hatched and are nothing more but empty shells while others have only started to move.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.7e1a1975-5bec-4fe2-a1c7-2933433d1445;Destroy the eggs!
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.715741b3-ba5d-4d96-8567-ce63c8c43841;These webs are a nuisance, burn them.

#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.e19e2eba-3f5e-40d6-9173-20bdd8908b73;Hide. We strike as soon as the spiders come out.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.efa12852-4117-43e6-a6c3-b52e69360b6b;You hack and slash at the eggs, not minding the webs you have to pass to do so. Some of the spiders give small hissing and chittering noises as they die and soon you begin to hear loud clicking. The parents have been alerted by the sounds of their dying brood.
Southwatch City Spider 1_2.b5ce8f10-babd-40f4-9bcd-645042473b55;It is a meager distraction but enough to give you first strike! Your troops charge into the flurry of battle and are able to deal a significant amout of damage already!

#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.eff5dfa2-3e95-48d7-bb9d-b2bf1112bf23;Fine. We kill those eggs then.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.42901693-be90-4338-be5e-430b88a63cef;Burn the webs.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.03991e5d-e05e-4aca-a06f-db4df5cbb786;You begin to clear the well of webs, but your movement through them has alerted the spiders. Some begin to climb out of the well while others come from nearby trees.\n\nYou don't have a lot of time inspecting them, but even a simple farmer could see that those are no normal spiders.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.669d4b5a-d4f5-4642-9cb5-5b2395e2ffa3;You wait a long while until finally a rabbit gets too close to the webs. It disturbs the sticky strands and spiders charge in from nearby trees and out of the well.\n\nWhile your troops manage to get the first hits in, they are tired and stiff from the long wait before hand. Even the adrenaline of the upcoming fight is not enough to fully awaken their weary bones.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.b40fe9cc-fb1f-4b4a-82ad-d146fdf6c09f;Having finally killed off all the arachnids, you make sure to clear the well of any remaining webs. While doing so you see something shimmering in the webs just above the water.\n\nYou retrieve it and find a glyph in your hands. It seems whoever dropped it into the well is responsible for the recent spider invasion. It's power must have drawn them here to nest.
#Southwatch City Spiders 2_2.2150d4ea-e58e-49d2-82b6-7959196b6b63;You return to Connach and the people are both appalled and relieved to hear that their torment is over.\nNone of them know who could have been responsible for dropping the glyph but they assure you to keep their eyes open.\n\n"Should anyone try something like this again, we will make sure to inform you.

It is high enough to overlook most houses – thick, as if it were centuries old.\n\n"Don't try to talk yourself out of this one, elf! We all know it was you!"\n\n"I lived here before you were born - despite the likes of you, mind - and never done harm to anyone!"

#Coldmark City Uncovering 1.f90500cd-79f6-4874-9da4-5cfb0c6f36bd;Greydusk Vale miners have come upon tunnels for old rail tracks. Further investigation has revealed that the Windwall Mountains were once connected to the Snake Pass.\n\n"We wish to reestablish this connection," you are told. "The railroad could lead to long forgotten adamantinum reserves. Animals and landslides have made the way impassable but with your help we should be strong enough to clear it."

#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.5683e166-5a70-4d5c-876a-03f230542cd6;A thin and sheer layer of ice has covered the walls and metal rails. Dwarves are building new carts and fitting them, hopeful that they might soon retrieve the valuable ores deep in the mountain.\n\nMany of them wish you good fortune, giving you some tools that might aid you as you prepare to clear their way.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.730dd7d2-0f3d-4f47-bfed-2b452705ed42;Let's venture inside.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.a401a9db-1596-4a06-a5ff-331a11332392;The first obstacle you come to, some twenty minutes later, is that the ground has caved in underneath the rails, leaving a pit large enough for three carts to fall through. The weight of one cart alone would probably be enough to drag the rider down and permanently break the rail.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.9f5d678a-7b70-403d-8ae9-b7895fe43ca8;I can close that up.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.892000f7-44e6-4726-b44a-eab3376baca5;We must dig out the walls and fill the pit.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.969a4118-0f0b-4864-b561-20fe7e68054c;It takes some time to fill in the ravine, which is tiring for all involved. You manage to dig out enough of the walls to add rough support to the rail tracks, but then you must continue.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.0b21071a-cb73-4148-befa-2eb84c3f867c;The ground rumbles, sending up some nervous cries as the very rock of the floor shifts and the pit fills itself in. The extra support will let any cart cross safely.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.4d96210d-3247-468c-ac63-be86df207048;Another hour into the darkness your way is blocked again.\n\nA stinking, bubbling, tarry substance covers the ground and has eroded parts of the rails. The smell stings in your nose and someone in your ranks heaves. It is acidic, metallic and most likely deadly to mortals.

#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.d1c5ef69-c6bc-4027-bf7d-89f3fe54a0ee;A little while later, an unfamiliar noise catches your ears. A growling, huffing and scratching is coming from one of the tunnels intersecting that which you are following.\n\nSuddenly, a gigantic creature steps out of the darkness, vaguely troll-like and covered in icicles.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.2bf090ce-c3c3-474f-a919-d342a78472fd;It takes a bit of time but with some experimentation, you find the right solution. You pour your own concoction into the pond, which begins to evaporate with a loud hiss.\n\nWhen the vapors have settled, you can assess the damage to the rails.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.b1786c46-7ff7-428c-be4c-d2e7dcb65eeb;Leave this cave now and never return.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.10204f3f-c77d-4f64-a80b-91d33f16ebd3;The large creature doesn’t have the intelligence to fight your magic, succumbing easily. As commanded, it turns and leaves. Soon, the stomping subsides and you know you are alone again.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.02a12a39-745e-4ad9-90ba-afbd85fbbd52;That should suffice then.
#Coldmark City Uncovering 1_2.633c7077-5867-432a-8fc5-1866e3f23322;At long last, the rails come to a stop and the tunnel opens up into a large cavern filled with old carts and mining equipment.\n\nIt takes hours to return to the city, but your long and tedious journey is bountifully rewarded. The dwarves celebrate your success, giving you a few valuable resources for good measure.

Several times, the captain points north and when the conversation comes to an end, glances in the direction of the rest of your troops before telling his force to stay on guard.\n\n"He insists that the only orders he takes will come from my uncle," Lytra tells you bitterly. "If we wish to liberate this place, we must do so by force."
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.2051fbf2-a69a-412a-8539-182f2d2b6080;Very well. Then that is what we shall do.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.c337dc63-69f1-4584-a085-6c02e787219a;We are not prepared for a fight. Fall back.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.67dcd936-ae99-4ec3-87a7-2ad7f2509677;You march your troops quite openly towards the hilltop. When he sees your banner, the captain gives you a respectful nod.\n\n"Well met, friend of the Westguard," he says. "It is good to see you here. But... why are you here?"
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.5f7d639e-7a8e-4422-969a-d65dc276a274;I would ask you the same question.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.34af1b4d-ee6b-48dc-8fc9-13d41d4b6c46;The captain looks a little uncomfortable divulging such information publicly, but slowly does so.\n\n"A... larger force is on its way to reinforce this location. With such a view of the ocean, and across the orc lands here, it is a good strategic location. In time, it may even make for a good frontier outpost.\n\nAnd you, great mage? You have not yet answered my question."
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.5b176139-dac6-43b9-a1d5-b5847c803515;You will return north the Westguard at once.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.19854b81-6a27-4b86-9192-92fff345c867;The captain blinks back surprise at your direct instruction. It takes a few moments for his mind to process it, but you can see resistance quickly failing.\n\n"Of course. Perhaps this isn't a good location anyway." he says quite calmly. More strictly, he turns to his troops. "You heard the mage! We march north at once!"\n\nThe troops are all slightly more suspicious of your command, but either too intimidated to speak up or glad to be leaving, they begin their long trek home.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.be933c9e-1c58-4369-95e4-84c6d3558ee1;A bloodless solution.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.2b6dfa88-2671-40ce-be16-d8f205f23cc9;Cancel the order and head back to the Westguard immediately.

#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.902acdee-11fb-4984-900f-7947d0af0d64;The captain's face falls. He thinks for a moment before ordering his soldiers away and motioning you aside for a quieter conversation.\n\n"We know, in the Westguard, that your own goals do not align with ours. We accept that this means our enemies are not necessarily your enemies but I must put that to one side. With all due respect, great mage, my orders are to hold this position. No... affection for the local population will change that. I am sorry, but if you wish for it to be otherwise, you must make it so by force."
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.a5e0f8ca-eab1-45e3-a427-f97bd8130de2;Then that is what I will do.

#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.50818957-5ab4-4e68-96a4-28f92b2fedb8;"Now hold on there..." The captain blanches but stops when he sees the look on your face. He stumbles over his words for a moment. One of your simplest spells leaves the distant echo of a tune in a threatening minor key whistling through the breeze and the captain swallows.\n\n"The Westguard does not take threats lightly, great mage," he says. "I will not risk the lives of my troops, so we will go. But do not think for a moment that this will be forgotten."
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 01.deab4d30-9180-4efa-9e27-33b14e5a1c50;Then we both get what we want.

#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 04.442df1a9-fd02-4132-8b94-7ffea54a97cc;When you come upon this shrine, a six foot marvel to Zarach shaped as a wild and angry warg, you find a group of orcs resting amidst the ruins of a recent fight, dead Purity zealots lying everywhere. One of the orcs uses her axe to tap the head of a soldier into a hole.\n\nTheir leader picks up his club as you approach, taking a few careful steps forward.\n\n"Don't try us, stranger! We are fresh from the hunt and ready to kill again if we must!"
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 04.bf486529-5464-4a9f-ab6e-ca3ca2af0664;We were sent by the shaman of Orgash.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 04.45aaa7cf-ddb5-43df-a55a-b1d12843c35b;The reactions vary. Some of the orcs laugh, some groan and roll their eyes. Some sigh and some even grow a little darker.\n\n"We are no friends of Toraq," their leader tells you, looking you up and down spitefully. "He is weak. His time imprisoned has riddled his mind and he wishes to hide in that fortress he builds us. He may as well be human."

It would be one thing if Toraq and his band of city builders only had the Westguard and the Purity to contend with, but other orcs too. They have their work cut out for them.\n\nStill, they are free to return to this shrine now, and you are sure they will be grateful for it.

It is the orc woman with the axe who speaks up, swinging it over her shoulder as she walks to stand next to the leader of the band. "We are orcs too. Why should this shrine to the Guardian who made us all only be given to them?"\n\nBehind them both, the other orcs are all starting to move forward now, their weapons ready.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 04.0dbd98b0-9bf5-43c6-b58f-3feb01d27ca0;Then we will do what we must. To arms!

Smoke is coming from our mine and some of our men have not yet returned. It smells of rotten eggs and death! We suspect magic might be involved!"\n\nYou can already smell the pungent odor. Thick yellowy gray smoke billows out of several cracks and holes and rolls along the main entrance's ceiling.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.6c9eebed-1e28-4249-8817-64fb680c2551;Let us have a look then.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.5a86da61-9ff0-4e91-95ea-3b0ecd7c202d;You enter a room where hot magma has leaked in, covering large parts of the floor. The air is harsh and unforgiving, scalding and blistering the skin, perhaps even burning thinner hairs on some arms.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.f2da5ab2-e08d-4255-a05d-0ff067a9b8c2;Your clever solution saves your troops from major burns and you can press on without further hindrance.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.ec64a1f2-ac5f-48a9-9edf-e3dedf0212f4;It is a hazardous move and some of your soldiers are seriously burned as they try to cross. The smell of sizzling hair, flesh and fabric soon hangs heavy in the room.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.362b30eb-5cd0-41d2-8999-c7f23ae23b0a;On the other side of the room, nestled in a crack in the wall, you find a hand-crafted statue of Niethalf, probably set here to keep miners safe at work.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.49670015-5d19-488b-b0cc-788dd69b850b;After all the hardships, you enter a cave where smoke is thick in the air.\n\nYou see a couple of unconscious miners, their gear still in hand. One of them must have found the sulfur deposit by accident, as he lies right next to a hole in the wall, where a pick axe is buried in the rock and putrid smoke spews forth. The noxious fumes are becoming unbearable.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.01bbfae8-a10e-49c0-8df0-0d5e561ee8db;Drag them out quickly!
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 1.2e6e5ba3-4021-470c-9c6f-ac294e7710d6;I'll seal the leak magically to stop the fumes!

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.f2f2b3b6-5376-4fba-814d-fbda1a422f28;On the other side of the ravine you find a cave covered in large mushrooms of a wide variety of colors. Floor to ceiling, they are everywhere.\n\nSome are moist and dripping, others are dark and shriveled like prunes.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.c656fe34-b9ab-40dc-8663-c3b14438fc72;The mushrooms leave a mellow, sweet taste in your troops’ mouths, coating the tongue like chocolate. They send a shiver up and down the spine, then a warmth, like ginger and pepper settle on the bones.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.2677d488-54f9-41e3-83c3-b04a7aefd8e1;A fine scientific experiement! Let's move on!
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.d5394993-5bcf-46ae-9d41-25383948af97;The entrance to this mine is inconspicuous and you start to question whether the dwarves have sent you to the wrong place.\n\nThen, suddenly, you hear a strange noise from inside, like crunching or rolling stones.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.196847d8-155c-4fa5-97be-acf2e0bb35e9;Let's delve in.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.f592f23b-cf74-433d-aa55-6c6ba520ec98;After a long walk, you come to a jerking halt. Here, the floor has caved in, leaving nothing but sharp rocks for your troops to land on if they fall.\n\nThe miners have installed ropes to cross but you are far from certain they’ll hold anything larger than dwarves.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.ef84bdb8-3716-4804-9053-87cd04e998b4;We better not touch those. Move on.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.c8c8826a-d5c7-4ab2-8ee2-8a94a1fe6f18;You pass through a particularly broad tunnel where ice covers everything. The floor is slippery and the moment anything is touched, there is a good chance of freezing to it.\n\nBut the sound of grinding stone is here at its loudest and all of a sudden there is a heavy thud behind you.\n\nGolems, well camouflaged by the stone, step out of the darkness and charge towards you.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.22a9f270-0cd9-4d00-8e2b-7b00f8d75227;Your troops draw the golems attention as best they can while you work on deactivating it. The icy ground makes it hard and as the golem takes a swing you manage to shut it down in the last moment.\n\nOnce everyone caught their breath, you take a closer look. The golem must have been a guardian to protect the ores and miners alike. The frost could be responsible for it malfunctioning.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.d81150ca-7b57-4227-89ff-6c52a71edb31;That's dealt with. Let's press on.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 2.74122fff-bb46-4555-8cab-293acc5dd611;Finally, another mine done.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.5c08167d-f80d-49d6-8727-ebdf5791ec71;It quickly becomes apparent, though, that the shifting earth is not your only problem.\n\nThe further you delve, the more white, silken threads span the walls. Certainly spiderwebs. It isn’t long before you hear the first clicking of mandibles as a clutter of spiders crawls around the corner.

#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.93237c60-89e6-4bde-9fa3-305b569834b2;You cast some sensory spells taught to you years ago by your master, pacing around the shrine, untangling the ethereal web of magical fabric around it.\n\nYour investigation reveals a series of magical locks, designed to oppress the original magic of the place. If you were to guess, you would say someone wanted to punish the orcs, keeping the dead shrine up as a reminder to 'mind their place'. Perhaps the Purity used a captured mage to do the work.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.f11af837-7470-41ae-bb00-11a36c00b5a2;I can brute-force my way through the locks.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.0887599d-657a-4238-aad4-dacfa6581d47;Fortunately, I know the spells to undo this.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.c4f212ec-0731-4ca7-af13-634cb8d0f262;Hmm. I must return to this later.
Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.91dc2d15-423e-4a66-b346-ea60cfeebec8;I am still not ready. I will return later.

#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.a7e23ad3-49f8-4789-ae03-d13dd079f489;Now I can undo the damage done.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.05509efc-48b9-4d4d-92c9-3c014ab1e0fa;Now that you have noticed what is wrong with the shrine once, it is easy to recognize when you are back in its vicinity. The world directly around it feels just that little more empty.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.d4871d33-dc41-4b5f-bbf1-2de9d312db42;Without the knowledge to do it in the expected manner, it takes time and a lot of energy to break through the locks. When you finally achieve it, you are noticeably drained but the effect is immediate. It is as though the scales of the world have been tipped back towards balance. The air feels right again.\n\nHopefully, now the locks have been broken once, the Purity will think twice before trying something similar again.
#Misty Coast Power of the People_Shrine 02.ca833adf-c824-4e23-8de8-f35c504e0b4d;With the knowledge of how to unlock the shrine, you need only time to methodically dismantle the Purity's act of spite. The effect is immediately obvious. The air feels right again, as though the scales of the world have been tipped back towards balance.\n\nWith their work undone, hopefully the Purity will think twice before trying something like this again.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.e007ea5b-89d3-4299-b7d4-d206f983de15;Not very far into this mine you come to a pool of sickly, green liquid that occasionally erupts in clouds of humid steam.\n\nIt is obviously acidic and would probably eat through your troupe if you tried to push on.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.40f2a708-aa76-4ed6-962c-04b65a31d806;I will counter the acids for us.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.98bccd2b-5fc1-4cae-b702-5aeb5fafef93;Cracks and fissures run along this mine’s walls and you see many thick, wooden beams supporting the walls and ceiling. A low rumble can be heard from within.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.bc8283a0-4f24-4a9e-9b49-7a5d1f9d58a3;Let's clean this out quickly.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.23a8a011-9bda-4633-978a-5cea2364632c;Another rumble shakes the mine, this one far more violent than the first. Stone, dust and debris begin to fall, hitting some of your soldiers before they can make way.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.8ea4246c-3e96-4058-8ec9-f82bb42830d5;You come across a leather satchel. Whoever left it behind, whether they fled or were eaten, must have done so some time ago, for it is covered in dirt and dust.\n\nInside there is some moldy food, but also a very usable potion!
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.b284fc9e-d2fd-437e-8e2e-c4c7268c7804;At last, something of use.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.a07a3eb7-3af8-4a13-982a-cf86343276fc;Around another corner you find yourself before a large boulder that blocks the path further in. It must have fallen out of the ceiling.\n\nThere cannot be much more to this mine. You are willing to bet the last chamber lies behind it.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.f696f337-8cad-4896-a8a8-a58170d65063;No stone can block our path.

You have finally reached the end of the line.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 3.88f53e7d-468e-43ad-b642-204a3d629f20;The dwarves can handle this themselves. We’re done.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.80263ba1-1ac7-4b8b-9a46-22f44020a1ad;After walking for what feels like hours, you pass a cave that has been sealed off by a large boulder that has been carved into very precisely.\n\nIt is certainly a dwarven script but you are unable to read it.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.b6a662ec-29c2-4f2e-9ec2-9cec2304235e;No sooner have you found the back of the mine do you see what is responsible for all the rumbling and quaking.\n\nGolems have found their way into the cavern, throwing the heavy equipment around and crashing against the support beams with tremendous force.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.4c1a4542-42cf-461e-a4fe-0d5201d9633c;With the constructs taken care of, the mine once more falls silent. There is some damage to be fixed with time and materials, but it does seem that it can be used again.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.e1c556d2-1b67-4171-86dd-1fdae331d445;This is a burial site. We should leave them be.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 4.38b86ffa-23ec-4a76-934c-7ed23f324387;The large stone is rolled aside to reveal skeletons lying in the middle of many offerings. Everything is frozen solid.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.951de763-b862-4ceb-8bd0-8a94c0eb6918;Some miners have taken up guard outside this mine. They get up to greet you, clearly warned you would arrive, but worry is heavy in their faces and voices.\n\n"A few days ago, some brothers were lost in the tunnels. It has never happened before – our sense of direction is very keen!\n\nEver since, we keep hearing their voices but never see them. I say their ghosts are haunting us. And won’t stop, until we give them a proper burial."

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.9915ca08-4bcb-49f6-a5e7-e809b1d94fe3;You step away from the main path, down a breakaway path which quickly seems odd. It is blocked off by a sheer wall that exudes a strange magical aura that you do not recognize.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.5482c1b4-13cb-466b-9604-b147809c4694;With some effort, the spell lifts and you find yourself in front of a steep decline into darkness. From below, you hear dwarven shouts.

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.0ba1e6df-775d-45c2-af81-cd753f11c34d;At the bottom of the shaft you see a small group of dwarves desperately defending themselves against undead creatures.\n\nA quick glance at the stone work of this level tells you it is not part of a mine at all, but a Shaper building. The undead must be centuries-old guards.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.81bfa5f4-7f58-4100-8849-14c6e94bad66;Help those dwarves!

Thank you."
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.daf195b5-74fc-4b24-ac3f-85fde6ff9b2e;When the undead are slain and the wailing finally ends, you have a moment to look around. The building is miraculously almost completely intact, preserved and untouched by the passing of time.\n\nSlowly though, the miners approach you, weak and exhausted from their long struggle and suffering many wounds.\n\n"You are sent by Niethalf himself," one says gratefully. "Thank you, mage."

#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.95ae4a1c-1e18-4eb6-8281-e8522bfc6e55;Somehow, though you are sure you moved further away, the wailing becomes louder until it reaches a crescendo.\n\nBehind the next curve of the main tunnel, you come face to face with a crowd of the undead. It is hard to say for certain they are dwarven, but they are certainly angry.
#Silver Drift Hollow Mine Dungeon 5.1e8669be-a04a-46ab-ba22-ae5e13ac4cb9;You could swear those undead with eyes look almost taken aback for a moment before they follow your command and shuffle around and head towards the back of the mine.\n\nAfter some time, the noises stop.

Now, it lies in dozens of pieces across the ground around where it once stood. It looks like there may have been a bowl, you can still see part of it attached to half a hand.\n\nRepairing the shrine will require the right spell or a vast amount of power.

A dwarf!\n\n"Why is no one helping him? Glamrig!"\n\nYou see a dwarf in a leather smithy’s apron approach the crystal with a large pick-axe. His eyes are red and swollen from crying. He swings hard, but his axe barely leaves a mark.

CirclePage.Title01.Localization;Founding of the Circle
CirclePage.Description01.Localization;The Circle was formed from the most powerful mages on Eo, each nation sending their best and brightest.\n\nIts goal is to protect the realms from strife and war as well as to gather and share knowledge to educate and nurture the people.\n\nIts members do not usually interfere directly in global affairs but use proxies or messengers, leaving many unaware of how they subtly guide the world.\n\nWith the Circle's foundation a century ago, Eo finds itself in a new, golden age of magic, guarded and directed by the watchful eyes of these assembled authorities on magic.
CirclePage.Title02.Localization;Discovery of Allfire
CirclePage.Description02.Localization;The Circle has its seat in the city of Mulandir. Sat on top of a demon crater, it is a place of learning, experimentation and great magical power.\n\nWhen the mages of the Circle discovered a means to access and master the Allfire, their powers grew manifold, but knowing the Allfire drives all to greed and, eventually, madness, they have guarded the power from others vigorously.\n\nAs time has gone by, the Circle mages have grown envious and suspicious of each other and cracks in their union have begun to manifest.

But the more you explain the situation, the more intrigued he becomes.\n\nIn the end, he sends an apprentice to the city with a tiny bottle of strange liquid. Upon pouring it over the crystal, its surface begins to warp and throw waves like water, then melts into a puddle.\n\n"Glamrig! Brother!"
#Silver Drift Hollow City Trap 1.beca1cbf-263e-4c82-a158-8af924f01226;It takes a moment before you hear a barely audible, "Gurim?"\n\nThe brothers fall into each others arms and onlookers all breath a sigh of relief.

The walls have shelves built into them. Some still hold trinkets, but most were scavenged long ago. Above all else, you feel the residue of a strong magic thrumming through the air.

Some words you can read but many are foreign to you.\n\nYou just about decipher ‘nature’, ‘guards’ and ‘fire’.\n\nOtherwise, there is nothing of interest here. A few knickknacks of no real value and some decomposing books that crumble to dust when you touch them.

You assume the on-off switch.\n\nLastly, you find a skeleton tightly holding a note book. This is odd, for neither book nor skeleton are old enough to be of Shaper origin. A perished explorer’s journal then?

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.54683805-78eb-4585-b64a-3e1b6042e70d;You find Toraq and Gruun building a small stone hut near Orgash's center, probably the widest, most open space in the whole city. Toraq sees you as you approach and sets a brick down with a hearty laugh. Even Gruun gives you a big smile.\n\n"My friend!" Toraq calls. He tries to put his hands on your shoulders, only to breeze through your apparation so that he claps. After a moment to reset, he says: "Thank you, for all you have done!"
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.239c81e0-4722-4363-a97d-8f9e7560546c;I'm glad to have been helpful.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.32fad5ad-99eb-4686-805d-c7fe7875a4ce;"You've impressed, mage," Gruun calls to you too. "My expectations were low, but you have made me start to believe this fool's hope that we can actually succeed."\n\nShe is clearly joking as she tilts her head at her partner. It is good to see them both in such a jovial mood.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.9524bf65-1fed-471a-81ab-9e56857d7eaa;But, I assume, the work continues?
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.b38df448-96b4-48fa-a357-bf31f7877d49;Toraq's face falls a little as you ask the question. He nods, going back to some building work as he explains to you:\n\n"You have already done much for Orgash - truly you have proven yourself to us. What... remains is a grim task that I have wanted to ignore, until now. You see, there are orcs here, on the Misty Coast, who... do not understand what it is we are trying to achieve."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.bcd02fc8-22f0-417f-ab36-22ab423e1e6f;Yes! I met some while helping your shaman.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.a68fe9da-846d-4fd5-a914-d27340fe5ef5;Is that a problem?
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.cd0547b3-a058-4e54-8f35-1c100f35d951;"I wish that it was not one," Toraq tells you as he sets a stone into place. "Things were... tense with them before, but they have now become worse. They accuse us of trying to force this place on them, say that we are just as bad as the Westguard soldiers.\n\nLast night, we were attacked and some of us were killed. This, I cannot allow."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.c8052abb-62ea-4694-93d3-89b681a97459;"She told me so." Toraq grunts as he sets a stone into place. "And that you, again, for helping with our shrines.\n\nBut... then you understand some of the problem already. They think we are as bad as the Westguard soldiers, telling them they must live here and do as we do. It has led now to open conflict. Last night we were attacked and some of us were killed."

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.a6c965ac-0f45-43c3-a801-bde6a1a62556;"No! No," Toraq insists. "Fighting each other in... these times of calamatous omens... I wish that we could all stand together. I wish for us all to be united. If they do not see it so, so be it but that does not mean we must destroy each other when we already face another war!\n\nThat is what I wish for them to understand," he tells you. "Just because we do not agree on the way forward, does not mean we must fight. There is room enough for all here."
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.a256910f-c246-47af-97fb-f60fa88ae7f2;So what would you have me do?
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.bbd2405b-2ffc-4eaf-9736-3e24d7b31e74;"And they can have it!" Toraq insists. "We have never once told them they must come here or help us build this place, we have told them they are welcome. There is room enough for all here! That is my message to them, that is what I want them to understand.\n\nThis attack came without warning, without any reason! I do not want to fight them!"
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.e8a564a4-4ab3-4568-a4fa-65ba0c003253;Toraq brushes his hands clean again and thinks for a moment before saying: "This is my problem to fix, mage. I know this. To do that, I must know what has changed, for I think something has.\n\nBut if I ask questions now, they will be suspicious. I ask you to find out what has changed - why they attacked us - and I will do the rest."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.7767097b-a035-4e57-9d67-34f01810a746;"Maybe." Toraq shrugs. "Of course you must do nothing either. I cannot and will not force you. But, if it helps, know that I ask you because you have built trust with us now, mage. It will not be lost simply because you did not help us once."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.6f85a747-f96b-47db-b81c-93d3733e8e9a;This seems beyond my purview.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation.4bd555cd-8132-4de6-a803-9f7f1f5c8823;Hmm. Very well. I will see what I can do.

#Shaper Ruin 04.111950a2-3f76-4aa5-968f-be1d3bc9ea3f;There is one peculiar piece of equipment where a funnel is used to move liquids into a large, glass bulb. There, they seem to mix with other liquids automatically. Judging by that, you guess it must be able to craft potions in moments! Truly a magnificent tool!\n\nOn a nearby shelf you find bottles, some broken and empty but others still corked shut, sealed with thick wax. There are also potions you cannot identify: One green, one blue, one black and one yellow.
#Shaper Ruin 04.8da5c86c-4e4a-4fdf-b59c-de748ee7cd75;I wonder what secrets we will uncover.
#Shaper Ruin 03.e2ee5b79-5d95-4312-97b0-58c4d307c8ff;Let's explore, but be careful.
#Shaper Ruin 03.d8e9d76e-5256-4e34-bfea-93f648992761;The vast chamber buried underground holds a variety of vases and statues, all cut from the same stone, gleaming with magic.\n\nA shelf on one wall holds a few rows of books beckoning you to thumb through them and your troops find tracks of dried mud leading underneath a closed, slender door. They must be fairly new, as some leaves stick to them too.\n\nFinally, right across the room from you, you see a large, black door, with statues either side of it.
#Shaper Ruin 03.e6c86e63-9a04-4422-be0e-95e107af55d5;I have to look at these books.
#Shaper Ruin 03.a16bb597-d13e-46e1-b1f4-f4d750036658;Inspect the vases.

#Shaper Ruin 03.e606c15e-cf7e-4eb2-8bc2-bf9e3fe7734f;Open the black door.
#Shaper Ruin 03.5134880e-3941-429c-90ec-c3a379a61cbb;Each vase, each statue, has tiny cracks that have been filled with pure magic. You can see it, shifting and coursing through the stone, glowing with every touch.\n\nIn one, you find a stone disk, carved with glyphs beyond your understanding. Without really thinking, you put it in a pocket, your attention quickly and suddenly turning towards the black door.\n\nYou really should look beyond it.
#Shaper Ruin 03.7daa9b60-9a00-49fc-921e-88b68d886718;No. I will look at the books first.
#Shaper Ruin 03.20c7d188-74cc-461c-b6fc-7bd8265fecbc;The ground shifts and pillars rise from the floor. They are shelves, stocked with a variety of well preserved ingredients and wondrous items. The whole room must be some kind of vault.
#Shaper Ruin 03.1a84b3be-21ee-4546-a562-118b48558705;Many of the books are written in a language you cannot hope to comprehend but there are diagrams you can read. You learn a little of how the Shapers used local flora and fauna to their advantage.\n\nSentences are short and the diagrams are clearly labeled. Was this a school perhaps? To teach young Shapers all about the world? Fascinating!
#Shaper Ruin 03.9d627f67-287b-4064-bd89-3602b1c51824;Back in the main hall, you are greeted with fluttering wings and scraping claws. The slender door now stands open and beasts are fighting over something. As soon as you step into their field of view, they turn to face you.
#Shaper Ruin 03.cd472b88-b1be-41b1-a096-ed1db4249a3d;Let's look at the vases now.

When the fight is settled, you look over the objects the creatures were fighting over when you first encountered them.\n\nGlass spheres of different colors lie across the ground. Some are cracked and empty, others hold something at their core. You pick one up and it liquefies in your hands, leaving a scroll behind.

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 01.0ffa9b22-cd02-4819-b8d8-793b74e251fa;The orcs look around at each other, suspicion growing in their eyes and hearts. It is eventually the orc woman who replies.\n\n"A wise mage came to us," she tells you. "He warned us of Toraq's plans to destroy us if we do not join him in Orgash. He gave us instructions to reach the Howling Steppes - quickly - so that we may raise our forces and strike first."

You see the orc describing the stones tear the scroll apart before he reaches for an already bloody cleaver and the leader calling for the orcs to rally.\n\nThe more time you give them, the more time they have to prepare themselves. Whatever the case, a fight certainly seems inevitable.

Suddenly, the engraver stands up and tears the scroll apart angrily, throwing the pieces into the ground.\n\n"I... I do not know his name." The leader looks like he is struggling with a distant memory. "He warned us that we were in danger. That we needed to call forth our forces from the east as quickly as we could."

#Shaper Ruin 01.73ae9b19-010e-4921-a20b-38aaa3df7618;Entering the ruin, you are in awe of the elegant structure the Shapers were able to create. Much of it is still intact, though the passage of thousands of years have not gone by without a trace. Plants have grown over most of the walls and paths. Deep cracks run through the foundations.\n\nStill, it’s beauty and tranquility is staggering.

Shaper Ruin 01.4e2f685e-e3f2-4209-b512-e9908f53eaf2;You recall one of the books your master had you read as a student. It told of the greatness of Eo’s first humanoid race: The Shapers.\n\nAlmost godlike, they came from the seed of life that the Allfather Aonir planted in the world thousands of years ago. Their understanding of magic and its workings were so deep that they could create masterpieces such as this place without so much as a thought.

#Shaper Ruin 03.13205e94-6ed5-45de-ae4e-b609403d39f0;The moment the first vase hits the floor, the magic springs up to search for a new vessel. You feel it seeping into you with an almost prickling energy.\n\nAbsent minded, you break another. And another. And another, until you are filled with an ecstatic feeling.\n\nIt is so distracting that you’re startled when the slender door bursts open with a loud crack.
#Shaper Ruin 03.11f297dc-4eaa-4a07-b8c4-1c8eaf88b306;As you reach the slender door behind which the tracks disappear, you hear it. Someone, or something, is beyond, breathing heavily and growling.\n\nYou are deciding whether to continue or retreat when it slams open violently.

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 02.896a4c52-59d4-4d33-b33e-d37f1811e933;You turn to leave, none the wiser to anything except that these were indeed the orcs that attacked Orgash. They seem happy to leave the Misty Coast behind them and take their gold with them - they shouldn't be any further threat to Orgash.\n\nThe question remains, though. Who paid them so much to attack the city?

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 02.aecfca3c-fa68-4ac4-9c24-0ff60bd3861b;The camp grinds to an eerie silence as your spell wafts through the orcs' minds and they stop what they're doing. Slowly, shaking their heads as though the original idea was ridiculous, they start unpacking the chests from the pack carts, hurrying and murmuring to each other about heading east as quickly as possible.\n\nYou are left with a truly monstrous amount of gold at your feet, but no idea who might have paid them so much to ransack Orgash.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 02.6ece0511-7d60-4708-b113-85493202a977;Hmm. This is a curious case.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 02.f24156a9-eb9b-4887-987e-3a75e6fe6248;Hmm. This is a curious case.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Group 02.737f8b07-5646-4328-9153-12c234e29cfe;Your company is slightly bewildered when you order them to bring forth another chest to add to the orcs' already truly monstrous collection. The orcs, though, are pleasantly surprised. They gladly tell you that they were shown this gold when their challenge was met and promised it if they could bring proof of a successful raid on Orgash, effectively amounting to mercenary payment.\n\nThis begs the question: Who would spend that much gold to ensure the orcs are busy fighting each other?
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.c97884f2-8e5b-4df1-b314-9e24534affe0;Here, then, lies before you evidence of the Circle's reach - a camp proudly waving Rohen Tahir's banner even after you thought you had rid these lands of his influence. It would be tenacious of him indeed to return himself so soon after such an embarrassing defeat, but a general or an apprentice must be working in his stead.\n\n
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.eb2a9b94-90ef-4b9b-9595-7ff6d13d07f1;You have heard of Rohen Tahir, whose banner flies proudly over this camp before you. He is one of the prestigious Circle mages, has a lot of gold and far less patience and is particularly interested in raw calculable strength.\n\nWhy that has left him to turn the orcs of the Misty Coast against each other, you are not sure. Perhaps some answers await you in this camp.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.62d9b385-d1cc-4ca4-9bbc-dc4935eeb651;Be ready for anything. Let's go.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.3ac3a38a-39bb-466f-84f9-6cdb40180e9b;I will deal with this at another time.

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.5ebef824-0361-4262-b829-a02dfbef2369;There is a tense nervousness around the camp that can only mean word of your victory over Rohen has spread. Some are wondering whether they should flee before they meet the same fate.\n\nThe garrison commander though, dressed in flowing mage robes and shining armor, meets you with one hand gently but pointedly rested on the pommel of a sword and the other gripping a mage's staff tightly.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.fc217e5b-328a-4c94-abcb-3ba82ba71f61;Explain yourself.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.704524ae-9073-49eb-9dbc-3fa2517a149d;I made it quite clear Rohen isn't welcome here.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.8c5369f8-ac31-4b07-be6c-d5be16a3983c;The apprentice chuckles and smirks at you haughtily.\n\n"I believe he made it quite clear that his strength would not be so easily diminished," he sneers. Looking at the company at your back, he warns: "You must realise you cannot win this fight."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.103b9b76-6070-420d-85be-60a35b3c7cbe;Explain yourself. Now.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.d2153cec-bfe1-44c6-ada3-ab00cb80c112;You will tell me what Rohen wants here.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.968ff8e8-07c1-4fd7-bc9c-ebba5561032d;"To the likes of you?!" the apprentices laughs. "Please. Rohen warned me that you were... difficult, but this is just sad. You will have to try far harder than that to make me betray him."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.47e96cac-67bf-49ab-822c-785818637374;Does the threat of orcish unity threaten his plans?

No mage of any skill would take such a tremendous risk.\n\n"An astute observation," the apprentice says mockingly, "but only tangentially related to the current situation. You are getting closer though."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.0e994fe7-e37a-456e-abd6-bebe9a83f74e;… He needs Orgash gone without the Westguard’s help.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.15141cb5-4fa1-407e-a0d7-b060e7c63574;It makes sense, you suppose. Rohen has depended so heavily on orcish mercenaries that any unity Toraq and the Stoneheavers create by giving the orcs a home will disincentivize them to work for him instead.\n\nBut the apprentice only gives you a mocking smile, folding his hands in front of him as if patiently waiting for you to figure out that you are wrong. That sends your mind down a different path.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.29450e8f-f788-4ed5-972a-ab8810ebcc7f;Orgash stands in the way of something he wants.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.9b1646c0-5d6d-446a-9664-d06898b56720;The apprentice's smile breaks wider as the pieces come together in his mind. The Circle are, if nothing else, always opportunistic. If Orgash sits on top of some hidden well of knowledge or greater access to the Allfire than none of them would hesitate to do whatever they thought was necessary.\n\nIncluding turning an entire people against each other to weaken them so the Circle could come in and snatch it away.\n\n"This is where you leave me to my work." Having let you had your revelation, the apprentice now shows you the path you used to enter the camp.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.b4bcf472-9e3b-4242-a2a4-82d212f14d94;The moment your lips have parted, the battle of wills with this magic user begins. Your domination is met by his fortitude and when they clash, you feel the weight of it in your mind.\n\nIt is immediately clear - you must commit as much power as you can to the spell if you wish for it to succeed, else it will quickly turn to the battlefield instead.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.7ff13daf-a0d1-430e-9e5d-4a0e10cc8503;You will submit to me!

After only a few moments, the apprentice drops to his knees from the effort, submitting to your victory.\n\n"There is a shaper ruin!" he gasps. Though he tries to resist, his hand goes to a pocket to draw out a map. "The entrance is buried beneath Orgash's foundations. The city must fall if we are ever to access it."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.29340fea-2415-4aec-845b-4a4792c58090;I'll take that. I suggest you pack up and leave.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.f52871ef-dfae-43da-9adc-346a779223bf;You don't need to magically manipulate the apprentice anymore. He scrambles up and backs away from you slowly, frustrated and a little afraid - perhaps of you, or perhaps of his master whom he now has to report to.\n\nScolded, he turns to his troops and gives them the signal to follow the instruction, leaving you to your prize.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.20557703-1d33-49bf-a3aa-40aed2cf1d4b;You can tell the moment you walk your troops into the camp that you are all on notice. Rohen's troops will start the attack as soon as you put a foot out of line.\n\nHe stands there, shimmering in the air to show you that he is just an apparition, waiting for you to walk close enough to talk.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.a3276263-e15e-4913-8ec0-e8b9bc0f4ec3;What are you doing here, Rohen?
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.eedd166a-32b8-43f4-bd62-5b13d74b869d;Rohen looks positively disappointed, chuckling softly.\n\n"You are in no position to make such of demands of me, mage," he says calmly. "Not yet, at least. Is that all you have? You will have to try much harder than that to get what you want if you ever wish to match us."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.75716b40-4feb-4be3-bd8a-f5a013d82dbf;The Circle cannot be allying with the Westguard.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.70f9991b-d39d-43bf-ac5f-3ff57c1387d5;You are destroying orc lives. For what?!
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.5b1a4310-68ae-431f-a8be-cff04535dbcc;You will tell me what is going on here.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.9b68d62b-be2c-47d0-8b90-95841a14054d;You wish for a fight then? So be it.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.4ce5b561-e99c-407a-940f-0ffebeeb6668;You speak the power of the Allfire into your words and feel it rush through the world around you.\n\nNot a moment later, Rohen's unbreakable will hits you like a hammer blow, threatening to send you reeling back. Your apparition is unaffected, but your physical form suddenly feels weak and shaky.\n\n"Not... that hard," Rohen says, amused. "I will chalk that up to ambition. Now, I suggest you leave me to my work, unless you truly wish to test me."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.2098e5c3-7daa-4773-af7a-d0721dcb7abd;Rohen's disappointment turns to genuine shock, confusion and even bemusement before he cuts you off: "Oh, please, spare me!\n\nYou must break a few eggs to make a good breakfast, and to be a great mage! The orcs have survived for centuries without any major settlement beyond the Needle. They will be fine. Meanwhile, we will progress as we must!\n\nIf all you wish to argue is morality then leave me to my work. Unless you wish to test me properly."

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.c956ba1c-4d49-4c52-8529-ec1dd1ec024a;Try as you might, you are not able to defeat Rohen's forces. The order to dismantle and move the camp comes before the fighting is through. They will no doubt know that word of their presence will reach Orgash now and that they must change tactics.\n\nThe bleeding is slowed but not yet stopped. That is the best you will be able to give Toraq.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.00470237-df96-4b29-9ac2-ab6deed2cee8;We gave it our all.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.afc1aa52-b3d6-4c2e-b7ec-ddd0ca6aabd2;You walk through the wreckage of the camp trying to find any hint of the reason for it to be here in the first place. You come to a big tent - perhaps a makeshift war room, from the size of the table that takes up much of the space.\n\nThere is no sign of Rohen, or any apprentice or any surviving military commander. Just a map of the Misty Coast, with markings indicating a dig site planned where Orgash now stands.
Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Confronting Rohen.bfd74f73-c43a-4f13-855b-1b161d9d1d91;Shrines... So Rohen wants to strengthen his troops.
#First Node.38a6bd65-7156-462b-808d-9bf826ff323b;Approaching the Allfire node’s location, you find it buzzing with activity. A swarm of insects has taken hold of it, no doubt attracted by the place’s alluring energy.

#Shaper Ruin 06.81d85892-c35f-49c5-9474-8b187603fabd;This was well worth our time.
#Shaper Ruin 06.23c1ebec-38a5-405b-9fad-999b715bdb9a;In the aftermath of the fight, you pluck a piece of parchment out of the air as it flutters on the wind. A precious morsel of knowledge.\n\nWas the beast in possession of it? Or was it simply dislodged in the fighting?
#Shaper Ruin 07.45773d86-e90e-4dd1-9c81-caa8a8894b79;You uncover a ruin of the long vanished Shaper civilisation.\n\nYour initial excitement is quickly dampened. There is barely even rubble left.

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.f505f6f5-1e08-4edb-8657-b430bbd6ef66;Your scouts report that Toraq is away from Orgash, in a camp on the Misty Coast. When you arrive there the mood is sombre and grim, many of the orcs nursing varying degrees of injury. Toraq himself has a bloodied leather patch strapped to his shoulder.\n\n"Please tell me you bring good news, friend." He grunts through his injury. "Today is a grim day - we have lost many friends."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.423c8595-df14-4538-9682-b0c822a7cbc3;Let me tell you what has occurred...
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.5762bf07-348b-4d00-ac4b-76ad45e2ecaf;In detail you explain that Rohen was behind the growing orc resistance to Orgash and tell Toraq of his plans to destroy Orgash to access the Shaper Ruins. He is grateful to learn that you have forced Rohen's forces from the area and that, as a result, the most violent resistance should simmer down.\n\n"Of course, I found a gift to thank you for your hard work," he tells you. "It pales now you tell me you have fought a Circle mage to achieve it."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.243d2563-8ff9-48ef-b5cb-7ef04ae73038;The Shaper Ruin is my reward for that.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.ec190690-3acf-486f-ab32-c888e6df7e21;In detail you explain that Rohen was behind the growing orc resistance to Orgash and tell Toraq of his plans to destroy Orgash to access the Shaper Ruins. He is grim faced when you tell him that you were unable to deter the efforts, but is at least grateful that, for now, the problem is dealt with.\n\n"With that time, we will bolster our defences, and we will know to look for signs in the future. Thank you for your help. I have a gift for you, in return."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.fb150cd7-f1e8-4692-ae80-b81bb69c0ef8;You tell Toraq the little you have learned and he muses long and hard over who might be responsible.\n\n"No orc clan here has that much influence and I cannot believe that any shaman would lead their people to such acts. It seems it will forever remain a mistery. Still, you have rid us of the problem and for that I must thank you. I have a gift for you."

#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.c47ef0a0-ec8c-4cf1-9b9e-0f8d099b1284;You describe to Toraq how you beat back both orc groups and he remains grim, crossing his arms with a pained look.\n\n"I would have liked you to discover the truth of the matter, instead of just... bashing through it," he tells you. "But needs must, I suppose. I do have one more gift of thanks for you, which you have still earned with your work."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.924a7fc1-aadf-46d7-ae80-ab0946e1ad8b;Toraq goes to his tent and comes back after some time with something wrapped in a cloth.\n\n"Please take this." He hands it to you. "I searched long and hard for an object of great power, to thank you for this and all that you have done for Orgash. I hope you can make use of such a thing. And your deeds will be shared at our table and many others across the Misty Coast for years to come. You are a true friend of Orgash."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.6ef99fc5-c8c9-4d0a-91cf-800ad87a6df7;Why... Thank you!
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.092dd59e-ac9b-48e1-a899-a480fdc2bbed;Toraq walks to his tent and comes back a few moments later with an object wrapped in cloth.\n\n"This was not the easiest thing to find," he tells you as he gives it to you. "To me, it seems only fair that you - who have helped us so much in this and in other things - get to keep such a thing. My family and my clan will remember you for many years to come."
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.dc8b5e1b-f124-47f5-bfc5-93badd25ca9a;I accept your gift gladly, Toraq.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.701e4b57-309e-4312-bf63-f7e63e610319;Toraq goes to his tent and returns a little later with an object wrapped in some cloth.\n\n"Many an object I don't understand has been brought to Orgash. I thought I would give you this as thanks for all you have done for us. You are a true friend.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.8d52b5c2-09b0-4dbf-969c-e396fc1a34d0;I will certainly find use for it, thank you.
#Misty Coast Cracks in the Foundation_Reward.3d4a403b-81f1-42eb-99d2-66d45140e93d;Toraq nods and grunts, then shrugs and immediately winces, clutching his shoulder.\n\n"And with that," he growls out, "our journey together comes to an end. There is still much more work to be done, of course, but less now that a mage such as you can help us with. The future looks brighter though. I hope we will weather the storm the shamans tell us is coming."

The once proud home of the Stormes is now overrun with banners and shields shining with the New Purity's silver dagger atop a blazing golden sun.\n\nThis is a dangerous place for any mage to find themselves. Perhaps the high generals of the Westguard in Bastion can tell you more about how the Purity claimed this place.

#Westguard Gossip 01.b82a3fcb-78d5-47ff-8fe2-41135a1e909f;On your way through this village you spot a wanted poster nailed roughly into a wooden beam supporting a large roof. \n\nIt is a crude picture of an old man with wild eyes in a pointy hat and flowing robes, and a haggard, old woman similarly dressed but all in black. Below the drawing, it quite clearly says: 'Magic is not for us. It is only for Aonir.'
#Westguard Gossip 01.246565ce-5e8e-46f8-b31b-3c7ab5e98bcd;There is a small crowd in this market square, huddled around a poster that has been pinned up over night.\n\nOn it, you see a crude picture of a crowd of people hustling and bustling about, with a person in the middle of them clutching at a hooded cloak that hides their eyes but not their smirking mouth.

The guard captain you speak to is wildly frustrated by the news.\n\n"As if orcs and trolls weren't bad enough, now the Granite Dwarves think they can take advantage of how thin we're stretched too," she complains. "Unbelievable. My commander is going to love this!"\n\nAmid her protestations, she writes a quick note and attaches it to a carrier pigeon, then counts out a small bounty in exchange for your information.

"Stay back, or we will destroy you!"

#Westguard Granite Dwarves 01.79940a06-46d6-4319-874f-4229dea4ba4f;Before the dwarves can argue, you cast your spell to shape the earth, so that the hill seems to knit itself apart before the dwarves' very eyes. The miners are astounded, even horrified. But when all as settled again, the leader turns to you.\n\n"Well. That certainly makes our work easier. As thanks you may take something from this place. Not much, mind! Niethalf is generous, not stupid!"
#Westguard Granite Dwarves 01.823697c6-8745-46c9-a8b4-2342b1db4628;Very well.
#Westguard Granite Dwarves 01.a8b4bd4f-b2b7-49ad-bfe1-e5a5b5d62c31;A magical fear leaps into the dwarves eyes as you speak.

The excavation leader nervously grips his axe. "Come on, lads! We'll reclaim Niethalf's gifts further north!"\n\nYou're left with the small hilltop to yourself, now with a crack running through it that one person would barely fit through.

If you take the time to dig them out, there is a small but quality amount of good resource to be gained, you think.
#Westguard Granite Dwarves 01.aceceb11-081e-4c99-b5f1-96c999531008;It is not a big space or a sprawling mine that the hill top opens up into.

Truth be told, the Granite Dwarves have travelled far for... not a large reward but that doesn't seem to bother them. And they are true to their word, passing a little of Niethalf's gift over to you when it has been dug out of the wall.

As the very earth had been closed up around it to make it look natural, you would say it was magically hidden.\n\nThis explains the sacks of pre-distilled Allfire crytals you find stashed about the place, no doubt hidden by some hedge mage in case of an emergency.

I have killed men for less!" she shouts, then gathers herself.\n\n"But you are young and obviously foolish, so I will let this one slide. Think about what you are missing out on and perhaps next time we meet, you will change your tune."

But your troops persevered and at long last you enter her richly adorned room on top of her tower.\n
#Ianna Tower.122accae-9325-4e15-9c67-191ebb5c71c1;Finally, she has to face me.

"They're preparing for battle nearby! They must have come up from the Misty Coast."
#Westguard Orcs 02.e1acb410-ba38-4cd8-9929-c2000f67a60e;Break camp and run!

#Westguard Orcs 02.dc6fd556-8b3e-445d-a351-bb2178cea7ab;My standing in the Misty Coast might help calm things.
#Westguard Orcs 02.af327354-628f-4116-8495-28c2f907e290;The orcs fight hard and vicously, shouting many war cries about destroying invaders and how you will never take their freedom. It is only when most have already fallen that you realise they must have mistaken you for soldiers of the Westguard or their allies.
#Westguard Orcs 02.e582a493-6d7b-48a3-88e3-7ef8db0c41ce;The orcs' staunch attack proves too much for your troops. Throughout the fight, you hear many cries about destroying invadors and how you will never take the orcs' freedom. It only strikes you when most of your troops lie dead that they must have mistaken you for soldiers of the Westguard or their allies.
Westguard Orcs 02.01b35a4a-e72b-419f-ba9b-c832e50e99b3;Perhaps this can be avoided in the future.
#Westguard Orcs 02.15abe9d1-5c04-43eb-816a-d3b86a288cd2;You ready your troops, just in case, but as the orcs approach you go to great lengths to show you wish to talk.\n\nTheir leader rides up on a tamed tickbug, reigning the creature in as the orc looks down at you.\n\n"Who do you serve?" they growl angrily.
#Westguard Orcs 02.1fa7c1af-3f15-4853-8304-024d88ef2839;I have met with Toraq. We need not fight.
#Westguard Orcs 02.16583ee7-4b22-45ea-8b89-707741d4b78f;No one but myself.
#Westguard Orcs 02.75a3ae18-7b55-4db4-9c9c-79491bb33a16;I am a friend of the Westguard. You should leave.
#Westguard Orcs 02.457b8ec6-e9a0-4872-9576-8aae0cfffbe7;You go into some detail about yours and Toraq's meeting, and describe what you have done to help the Misty Coast. The orc still looks doubtful but gives the order to their troupe to stand down.\n\n"Toraq says we should only fight those who threaten us," they tell you. "I am not sure where you stand, but if you tell the truth then you do not. If you lie then Zarach will decide your fate. Tread lightly, mage. These are dark times."\n\nWith that, the orc spurs their tickbug back around and orders their soldiers away again, off to find soldiers of the Westguard to give their message to.
#Westguard Orcs 02.d3d76736-58c1-4d14-bf2d-1e3d676aae4f;The short answer is not nearly enough to shake the orc from their doubt and distrust. They look you up and down, then glance at your forces too.\n\n"So you would help us if it suits you," they say cautiously. "And help our enemies too." They wave an order at their troops that seems to indicate it is time to leave.\n\n"Tread lightly with the Westguard, mage," the orc warns you before following. "They are as savage and monstrous as they say we are. You may come to regret helping them, no matter what they promise you."
#Westguard Orcs 02.94dad379-6bef-4a28-819e-e263e65482d2;I'll consider myself warned.
#Westguard Orcs 02.31679f8b-7760-4685-bf27-5fb84b0b9381;The orc's fingers wrap tighter around the weapon in their hand and they flash their fangs at you. The tickbug prickles too.\n\n"The soldiers of the Westguard are the savages they say we are," the orc growls. "They burn villages, they kill our children. We are here because we want it to end. Are you sure you want to stand against us?"
#Westguard Orcs 02.e7607921-9f3b-4b47-bdf5-b8634f757c66;No. Not when you put it like that.
#Westguard Orcs 02.e2cb554f-3da8-44b8-817a-fe575a86dc1a;I know where my loyalties lie.
#Westguard Orcs 02.4e98916e-cddc-45ea-8bb5-07a7eaae0062;The speed at which the orc leader called the charge took you by surprise but you rally your forces to a hard-fought victory.\n\nNo doubt your standing with the Misty Coast will suffer for the clash but for now you are free to go about your business.
Westguard Orcs 02.b1da276e-b815-4635-a452-3ec11f9d206a;My loyalties may be tested here...
#Westguard Orcs 02.f43baa5d-6951-4258-834d-1abca620a448;The speed at which the orc leader calls the charge takes you by surprise and the orcs wash over you with lightning speed.\n\nIt is likely they will take word back to the Misty Coast that you stood against them and your standing there will take a hit. Such is the price for getting in the way of a war.
#Westguard Orcs 02.0f51b0f3-2b5f-4d17-9959-343a8e66defd;"Good," the orc grunts. "We will leave you to... whatever business you have here. But be warned, mage, should you help the invaders in their quest to destroy us, we will not hesitate to bring you down with us.\n\nGo to Orgash. Speak to Toraq. You may find that we can offer more than your friends here."\n\nWith that, the orc gives his troops some order to fall back, slinking away on his tickbug.
#Westguard Orcs 02.1bdbae0c-fe41-479c-b7b0-841d85b8991d;Perhaps I'll do that.
#Westguard Orcs 02.0292b5b8-807d-4aa4-a19c-2d0a10e3ee89;In the middle of the night you are called to a camp in the Westguard.\n\n"Orcs from Orgash have snuck through the Westguard army's lines to find us," one of your scouts explains. "They ask to talk with you, urgently."
#Westguard Orcs 02.2cfe3587-2a86-4742-a5df-083854351d09;What is it they want?
#Westguard Orcs 02.668d61b9-9ad6-4d5b-a381-e41ae4f6467c;The orcs are all dressed in dark colors that hide them in the dead of night. They are guerrilla fighters and their number is small.\n\n“Forgive the hour, mage.” One of them steps forward. “We require your help. We were attacked not far from here a few days ago – not all were lucky enough to escape capture. Would you help free our brothers and sisters?”
#Westguard Orcs 02.d6a1d064-ba49-487d-bef0-b05fc2ac2e02;Of course! What is your plan?
#Westguard Orcs 02.3ceb8b8c-eb32-44dd-909d-13405a5b0a23;What is in it for me?
#Westguard Orcs 02.cba5ba43-ae96-4580-95e5-518963e349ef;I do not have the time to spare.
#Westguard Orcs 02.97ea853c-9305-4b48-8fc0-df816db747b1;The orcs are shocked you would ask but their leader quietens them down.\n\n“Word of this will be brought back to our city on the Misty Coast,” he tells you. “I will tell Toraq of your deeds myself, and you may keep whatever there is in the enemy camp – we have no need of it.”
#Westguard Orcs 02.8a2fea33-a9a5-4e5a-bf9e-e900e5311b6f;Alright. What's your plan?
#Westguard Orcs 02.93ac35cb-13f0-4937-86bc-712cfb5d2ab9;I'm sorry. I don't have the time.
#Westguard Orcs 02.c599d4e0-37ab-4219-a41d-88062aca2305;The orcs are disappointed to hear your response. A few groan or begin to despair at the news but their leader quickly rallies them.\n\n"Enough!" he states. "We will make the attempt alone if we must, though it will cost our lives.”\n\nAs the orcs begin to get under way again, the leader turns back to you. “Sorry again, mage. I do not hold this against you – I only asked as you have already proven to be our friend and ally. Good hunting!”
#Westguard Orcs 02.41a3cc06-cdf8-4f55-b430-079475ce811e;This really isn't my problem.
#Westguard Orcs 02.ef82ce32-bdaa-4a7d-ba7c-0d677946a563;The orcs swell with joy and relief as you tell them what they want to know. The leader gives you a toothy grin.\n\n"Thank you, mage. This helps much. We simply need a distraction so that we may approach the camp quietly. Many of the prisoners are injured and unable to fight – we must have time to get them to safety.”
Westguard Orcs 02.807950e6-621c-40fd-b0cc-05bc9edce1be;Good luck. I hope you free them.

"I don't presume to know your business, but I am confident in guessing this is not like anything else you have done recently.\n\nBring what forces you can muster. It will take many to bring Stormwatch Faste back under our control."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.f3ba6338-2ae6-46ff-9926-2b3852e441d1;In Plain Sight
#Westguard City Adventure 02.0daf1a73-2777-4a31-ab03-4950be77c078;You have barely made it into Bastion before a troupe of Westguard soldiers march up to you and demand your attention.\n\n"Lord Commander Storme wishes to see you," you are told hurriedly. They lead you towards the keep and into a waiting room at the back. You feel like a thief, hidden away from the public eyes. A door hidden in the wall slips open, beckoning you closer.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.3f99fb4f-02b6-4c59-acbe-99118888e8ab;What is the meaning of this?
#Westguard City Adventure 02.e2c2acda-f686-4bcc-8c48-67d77ef2d529;This room is littered with books and papers, beakers and bottles. There is a starmap etched into a golden globe that seems to spin on its own accord at the center of the room, and on a board to your right you see magical formulae that you only recognize from your own master's musings on the Allfire.\n\nSomeone clears their throat as they close the door behind you. You turn to see Reinald surpressing a bemused smirk, wearing very fashionable but otherwise very similar robes to your own.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.82defe3b-968c-4252-8124-f42c3d3d3c17;You ARE a mage!
#Westguard City Adventure 02.f2a009eb-6cbe-44da-9fbf-eddacdd7e651;Uncle! What is the meaning of this?!
#Westguard City Adventure 02.95d53303-98eb-4c34-b1f3-70435f71cd09;I'm... I'm very surprised.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.e9fc3d8b-074c-4f2f-bee4-1d810c2a5e0e;"Yes," he replies curtly. "And I would appreciate it if you didn't simply blurt it out in front of my troops next time. Being a mage in the Westguard is an increasingly dangerous thing, these days. Besides that, it's rude."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.818d506c-6440-436a-ba35-852e07b17687;"Mages in the Westguard learned to be subtle even before my brother let the Purity take hold here," he tells you with a growing smile. "Magic has always been seen as a threat. And let's be honest - in the wrong hands it can be."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.ef9a6353-41d6-49c4-b0d1-3ba56de836c1;Lytra is caught somewhere between absolute horror and utter fury for a few moments before storming forwards to hug her uncle with astounding force that makes Reinald baulk.\n\n"Why didn't you tell me?!" Lytra demands. Reinald gives her a softly pained look.\n\n"You know why, Lytra. I can't have your father finding out. It wouldn't end well for either of us."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.f2169fb4-0f6e-428f-8970-ae16e915e027;Apologies. It won't happen again.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.4c633655-cca8-43f4-b95e-98e2b0c3f7a4;You hide it well.

#Westguard City Adventure 02.152c74ad-c86d-45d5-92d7-b2699bffbe12;So what now? Are you in danger?
#Westguard City Adventure 02.87626649-d92a-45c2-bd79-4fc0cd348429;Reinald becomes tight-lipped and invites you to sit down, sitting on the edge of a desk opposite you so that he can look out of the open window.\n\n"My brother was once valiant, proud and strong but his frustration and anger have boiled down to hatred and the Purity are using that to turn him against the people. What started as a loose alliance has become Purity priests and zealots making decisions for Rengar," Reinald tells you. \n\n"You have already proven yourself a friend of the Westguard. I need your help to push them out before it is too late.."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.586abb88-c12a-4d07-91de-5d2ea64b625e;I am certainly no friend of the Purity.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.954e1e65-e398-459f-8b1a-d5269cc6a49e;That is quite some risk you ask of me.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.adebdc84-9bb0-49b9-8cea-6444cb198ccf;And where do you stand with the Circle?
#Westguard City Adventure 02.dee57b40-5b21-4ae9-a5b2-6e98ef97e590;"I know their names and reputations but they don't know me. At least... not by Reinald Storme."\n\nHe thinks on it for a moment, scratching at the small scar on his cheek, before he shrugs.\n\n"I fear asking them for help would alert my brother. For the time being, I cannot risk that - not until I have more support from the other leaders of the Westguard. And that is where you come in."
Westguard City Adventure 02.e08cc82e-c548-498d-8a69-1e6d900f4eac;I'm listening.
#Westguard City Adventure 02.0cf054f5-4552-454b-9589-97f9f5074e9b;"And you are an outside force expected to act independently," Reinald makes clear.\n\n"If you were to remove Purity forces from this land, your standing in the Westguard would likely remain unchanged. In fact, there is a chance it might still go up if the right person hears of it. Not so with me. If I act without more support from other Westguard leaders, I will plunge us into a civil war that only hurts the people more than they already are hurting. That is why I ask for your aid."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.f22c0a3f-46cc-484f-816d-413f7715f6bd;"I know." Reinald nods solemnly. "I have heard stories of what the Purity does to the mages it catches. It puts what they do to those they only think are mages to shame, which is saying something."\n\nAfter a moment of thought he adds: "I cannot move against my brother without the support of other leaders here. It would plunge us into civil war. That is why I need your help."
#Westguard City Adventure 02.17a16a6c-f1d2-4cfc-a75a-32673b171fd2;"I wish to move against Stormwatch Faste," Reinald tells you. "Make it clear to the Purity that they do not have the power they think they have. I am... urging others to support me in this, but - in the meantime - there are Purity figureheads at work in the Westguard that can be removed."\n\nThey may have information that makes retaking the keep easier, when the time comes. If you can acquire anything, I would be most grateful."

You hear the Purity soldiers shouting and calling for order as confusion takes hold.\n\nIf you strike now, you know they will be disorganised.
#Westguard Purity Leaders 01.75d3a693-2ea1-4408-bb31-10875d3b1b6f;You scour the commander's tent for any information you can find on Stormwatch Faste, hunting through pouches, chests and reports.\n\nIt is in the draft of a letter the commander had been writing you find it: They were writing a complaint to their superiors, warning about the risks of using paid mercenaries in the defense of the city. They feared a lack of dedication to the cause would more easily lead to turnabout. It is a fear you may be able to confirm. 
Westguard Purity Leaders 01.9a5edebf-760e-479b-92ce-9435b7c24821;Excellent! This will be a great advantage for the siege.
#Westguard Purity Leaders 02.708b9321-d44f-462b-9e91-2bd424270f29;On the mage hunter's body, you find a letter tucked away in a pocket, requesting that the company return to Stormwatch Faste posthaste to bolster the keep's defenses.\n\nThe letter says that current deployments are not enough, and that the barracks and Court of the People's Council have been prioritised over the shrine to Aonir that is under construction above the old shrine to the Guardians. Should the keep come under siege, that may be an exploitable weak point.
#Westguard Purity Leaders 02.86beac04-ae5e-4448-8f4e-50b190cd7ae2;You come to a small village in the Westguard where it looks like the Purity is hunting mages. An entire battalion of well-armed and armored soldiers are shouting orders at the villagers while a mage hunter interrogates a scared, old woman.\n\nTo have such forces at their disposal, they must be an important person to the Purity’s plans.

I doubt I'd be able to do the same again. But their forces are weakened for now."

Reinald shouts as the fighting begins to die down. "Rally! You, start tending to the wounded, the rest of you, rally to me! Mage! These soldiers would have made the taking of the keep itself nigh on impossible, I think. You did well to take them out of the fight here! We must line up and march on the keep together, meet the rest of our forces before the doors! When you are ready, speak to me. There will be no turning back!"

Stormwatch Faste.eed18ae1-726d-41d5-aa13-6ddb2d8dd04e;I am ready! Let us end this!
#Stormwatch Faste.78c1ec7e-7fc7-4511-97b3-b44c1e7e6d1d;The fighting has barely ended when you hear shouts and screams from nearby. Without realizing, you have been fighting in front of a dozen cages, each holding a human prisoner!\n\n"Get the Councilors free, now!" Reinald shouts to his soldiers. To you, he says, "I didn’t know the Purity had imprisoned the People’s Council. It is no wonder they had such a hold on the land. I will ask them to rally the people before the doors of the keep. Perhaps they will turn the fight in our favor. When you are ready to start the final assault, let me know, mage. There will be no turning back."
#Stormwatch Faste.59b058ad-767a-486f-8bca-a1ce57e5860e;The Purity have removed the idols to the seven Guardians from the faste's shrine, leaving only Aonir standing tall and proud. Some of the soldiers that rush into the square behind you immediately start shifting the ancient stonework that has been lain down, bolstered by the idea that the Guardians will look down on them in kindness for the coming fight if they set the idols right again.
#Stormwatch Faste.2f179011-9920-434c-bab6-6d020797f293;But... something feels off...
#Stormwatch Faste.241eb8a8-8086-4834-ae78-d7a6922cd59c;An uneasy feeling settles in your stomach as you consider the relative ease of the fight. With the keep itself still to be taken, you are unsure of how many reinforcements the Purity could call upon when you are so close now to victory.\n\n"I agree," Reinald says when you quietly voice your concerns. "The coming fight will be difficult. But we cannot stop now. Let me know when you are ready. When we push forward again, it will be to the end. And should we fail, we will likely not get another chance."
#Stormwatch Faste.1b56126d-df45-4504-a78c-41e465d96190;You return to the rally point that Reinald has set up in Stormwatch Faste, where the wounded are still being tended to, slowly being taken out of harm's way, and the battle-weary are waiting for you to arrive.\n\n"Are you ready?" Reinald asks when he finds you. "Once we do this, there will be no going back. And should we fail, I doubt we will have the chance to try again."
#Stormwatch Faste.eaecb5aa-1c80-4169-8338-3bddada5c59a;There are some meager defences on the way to the keep, small groups of Purity soldiers who flee at the first sign of trouble or are cut down by Reinald's forces on their march through the faste.\n\nYour victories have allowed other victories too. As the Purity have fallen back for their last stand, Westguard forces have taken other key areas, joining you now as you converge on the keep itself.
#Stormwatch Faste.414b7e54-01ca-4053-83d3-10d18d5fa50a;Onwards to the end!
#Stormwatch Faste.7777cf0a-4280-4f72-9f67-44f612853de2;The moment the keep comes into view, your heart fills with a little dread. You cannot count by how many you are outnumbered and the strongest units have been left until last. Not taking the armory on your way here has come back to bite you, no doubt.\n\nBut as your troops' confidence starts to waiver, a horn blows nearby. Everyone turns to see orcs scaling down walls, taking up firing positions on the rooftops and preparing to join the fight.\n\n"Of course!" Reinald shouts, rearing his horse. "Of course they attack here and now! Rally, troops!"
#Stormwatch Faste.3bbeb9f1-6f60-4421-87eb-be54b3187e39;As the keep comes into view, your confidence falters a little. There are still many Purity forces to fight through, even with their strongest and most numerous reserves already accounted for at the armory. \n\nBut before the charge is called, a horn blows out nearby. You all turn and see orcs scaling down walls, taking up firing positions on the rooftops and preparing to join the melee too.\n\n"Of course!" Reinald rears his horse to face them. "Of course they strike now! Rally, soldiers!"
Stormwatch Faste.ab69df6a-057f-434c-9180-0d4b2b66877c;Wait! They are not here to attack us!
#Stormwatch Faste.9432c657-d915-4ed7-ae0e-182449db8ee2;You remember the orcs you freed from Purity custody - a dozen of them at most who have honored their agreement to help you take Stormwatch Faste. They must have been watching the entire fight, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike!\n\n"Blood for Zarach!" one of them shouts as they run towards the Purity with an axe raised. "Blood for Orgash!"
#Stormwatch Faste.6cdb8072-e329-4576-becd-0f051fd6c5ec;Charge! Charge now!
#Stormwatch Faste.53ff791d-b9af-4ae6-9d89-55deaa92abb0;As the keep comes into view, your heart fills with dread. You are outnumbered. Two to one? Three to one? Honestly, it doesn't matter. Not taking the armory has come back to bite you and the keep has been reinforced with some of the Purity's strongest, most specialised troops.\n\n"Hold strong!" Reinald shouts to you all as the lines draw up. "Hold strong! We can do this! Now! To battle!"
#Stormwatch Faste.f6488c59-0d6e-40b7-8fcc-5c8b006cf921;You find yourself glad that you took the armory on your way here, dealing with the forces the Purity must have been hoping to keep in reserve for this very moment.\n\nThe odds are still against you, but you think there must be a reasonable chance of success as Reinald calls the attack.\n\n"Hold strong!" he shouts as he rears his horse. "Now! To battle! Glory to the Westguard!"
#Stormwatch Faste.512c861e-3651-459e-b934-8f52a5004299;"Fall back!" Reinald shouts. "Fall back! Out of the faste!"\n\nHe slices through one last Purity soldier before making his way back towards your own losing battle. He has lost his horse and carries a heavy wound in his side.\n\n"We have failed, mage." He is breathing hard. "Save your troops. This place belongs to the Purity for now."
#Stormwatch Faste.310c97b2-84ac-4311-a283-28dffc2b7b5a;We were so close!
#Stormwatch Faste.f1748027-ea87-471c-85f8-e231fcd701fd;The Westguard armies are still making their way away from Stormwatch Faste, carrying their wounded away on stretchers and their dead on carts.\n\nReinald seems determined to stay until the work is done, looking at the ruined gates of the faste with regret and bitter resentment.
#Stormwatch Faste.41f15833-fde5-48a0-ad35-1080306d8aa1;We could try again.
#Stormwatch Faste.5f4430e3-7d84-446a-bebe-6c6c1e823879;We did everything we could.
#Stormwatch Faste.135f8b96-7cac-4667-9190-36c301707ea3;"No, we couldn't," he says after a heavy sigh. His wound must twinge, as he grimaces and groans. "We already have word that the Purity is sending fresh reinforcements to make sure the keep does not fall.\n\nPerhaps you can keep finding fresh troops to throw at the problem, but for us it is over. At least we are united against the Purity and my brother has been denounced as lord of the Westguard, but for the time being we must allow them to stay in Stormwatche Faste. Let them rot there."
#Stormwatch Faste.5e909f02-94a2-4c96-8385-d82e2a673ff0;Reinald nods, then his wound twinges and he groans and grimaces.\n\n"Perhaps in another version of events, some decision was made differently or Lady Luck was on our side," he says. His voice becomes bitter. "We are still united against the Purity and my brother has been denounced as lord of the Westguard, but while he and the Purity hold this place, they will continue to be a threat to the land. We must withdraw for now and concoct some other plan to dislodge them."
Stormwatch Faste.c441f6ce-3db0-4c67-84bb-ae2feda39c44;I wish things could be different.
#Stormwatch Faste.40a832b1-0c44-40c8-892b-fba03438a5d3;Much like before the fighting began, Purity banners now decorate every surface of the outer walls again. It is clear to see that it is defended by more soldiers than ever before and any assault on the keep would be nothing but a waste of life.\n\nIt fills your heart with a sting of regret, but Reinald was right. The fight for Stormwatch Faste is over.
#Stormwatch Faste.1fe92c4e-8629-4b9c-930e-30e0bb35cbcd;I should turn my mind to other things. For now.
#Stormwatch Faste.1dd2f39a-e7b1-4064-af49-f473040bc627;"Victory!" Reinald raises his sword high, rearing his horse again. "We have victory!"\n\nA roar of cheers goes up all around you from the Westguard armies. Those Purity who remain try for a few more senseless moments to fight on but quickly realise it is doomed. They put down their weapons, drop to their knees and raise their hands, looking nervously at the victors.
#Stormwatch Faste.4354395d-8aae-4907-8e3e-97ef5c325516;Well fought, soldiers! Very well fought!
#Stormwatch Faste.a4d19720-662a-4419-88b6-21227cfa7444;While the wounded are tended to and the prisoners marched away, the orcs who came to your rescue waste no time in making their way over to you and Reinald and make swift work of explaining why it is they are in the Westguard to begin with.\n\n"We were promised that attacks on our villages would end." One of them shoots a dark look at Reinald. "Will you break your word?"
#Stormwatch Faste.ded34f87-40ac-4393-a6f1-90aa40602fe4;This is a chance to bring stability to both regions.
#Stormwatch Faste.36d4dbf9-8de2-44a4-8692-219119ab2954;All the best with the negotiations. I have artifacts to find.
#Stormwatch Faste.0ce185f3-4a07-4a03-81bd-e43a0880d465;You mediate talks between the two parties for a good couple of hours at least.\n\nIt is clear that the fighting will not stop entirely, grudges on both sides are engrained too deeply. But progress is made. Reinald promises that more care will be taken in picking orcish targets and apologises for the loss of innocent life. In return, the orcs agree to scale back their attacks on the Westguard.
#Stormwatch Faste.d3d270f3-32a0-48da-802e-72de70fd22a7;These were productive talks.
#Stormwatch Faste.0a1a5aa7-18e5-4894-9f5b-af361ef8bf99;Even in the buzz of the aftermath, the world seems strangely quiet compared to the noise of the fighting. Reinald wastes no time in ordering the wounded to be cared for, but then comes straight over to you.\n\n"The magical artifacts the Purity stockpiled are likely to be kept in the vault. They put them there to study. To know their enemy, for what little it did them. You are welcome to all of them. It is the least you deserve for your help."
#Stormwatch Faste.904d9dd1-0e24-427b-ab18-30072898fe72;I will seek them out.
#Stormwatch Faste.8cf804b9-1c4a-4485-ba67-12a2b55130b0;You find the Faste's vault buried half under the hill on which the keep itself stands. The door is not difficult to open, revealing a horde of treasure that must have taken the Purity months or even years to collect.\n\nThere are artifacts of a broad range of power, books and papers of different mages' notes from all across Fiara. Potions, glyphs, captured souls. You will certainly find use for it all.
#Stormwatch Faste.0dcda57d-aa1e-4203-9add-2a1f3f3ce827;This is certainly worth all the effort!
#Stormwatch Faste.7ac60bbd-37e4-4561-b3ea-f66ab639d98b;What of my father?
#T_CrystalDestination.e69ef5a2-7e6e-443a-a0ae-11888c71cd6e;Approach the corpse.
#Stormwatch Faste.ea86d7bd-fe1d-4729-a777-25b9f427ddd4;A little later Reinald finds you again, surprisingly calm and collected given the scale of all you have achieved.\n\n"I must thank you for all you have done for the Westguard," he says. "Stormwatch Faste's doors will forever remain open to you. May its military schools bring your troops much good battle experience. The Purity may still operate in the Westguard, but never again will they have such a hold as they had."
#Stormwatch Faste.9ffec9a4-4748-46f6-9ff4-bd14fabe473d;What of your brother?
#Stormwatch Faste.2c3d50e3-d05e-43cb-bc9f-c28acf3b4cf9;My father's legacy is finally over.
#Stormwatch Faste.30a3fbe7-a549-4ad9-a535-6630dc1405a0;"Deposed, but not here," Reinald reports. "He must have escaped with some of his soldiers during the siege." He pauses for a moment before adding: " You are the Lady of Stormwatch Faste now, Lytra."\n\nLytra blinks, suprised by the sudden statement. "I have duties to fulfil, uncle. I couldn't possibly..."\n\n"Go and fulfil your duties." Reinald claps her on the shoulder. "Be an example our people can follow. I will take care of the place until you are ready."
Stormwatch Faste.a3a5bb57-4b09-43cc-8fb2-19c306866289;We should finally be on our way.
#Stormwatch Faste.3965bedd-7101-4a68-9fb3-56aaaea909bd;"Indeed." Reinald becomes stony-faced as he speaks. "I was... surprised to learn he had already fled the Faste but... yes, let's focus on the positives. He is finally at peace, and hopefully we are on the way to it."\n\nAfter a moment he adds: "You are the Lady of Stormwatch Faste now, Lytra. Don't worry. I will tend to the keep while you tend to your duties. Be the example our people can follow first. The Faste will still be here when you return."\n\nLytra swallows down obvious nervousness, nodding quietly to herself as she looks around at her new charge.
#Stormwatch Faste.340240e0-d14b-4a42-b743-65b235b52a2a;"Dead," Reinald states. "He was a shadow of the man he used to be. What the Purity had done to him... if they even did anything, I do not know. But... he is at peace now and his daughter, Lytra, will inherit this keep.\n\nI will reach out to her. She will want to know of all of this."
#Stormwatch Faste.70431aea-3cd9-42a4-95a2-6b36795d4b7f;Alright. I will be on my way then.
#Stormwatch Faste.d8f0314a-febf-4067-a76a-025f339f9eaf;"Not here." Reinald shrugs. "He must have fled with some of his soldiers during the siege. Still, he has been deposed as lord of the Westguard. That title and this keep now falls to Lytra.\n\nI will reach out to her to discuss this but fear not, she will not be expected to return home until after her work with you is done. She must set an example for our people to follow."
#Stormwatch Faste.55f13c39-1262-4651-8a7b-34ded44308dd;What happens now?
#Stormwatch Faste.cea9b099-0b1f-43d0-ba48-9d65695fec05;Very well. I will finally be on my way then.
#Stormwatch Faste.f535ff8a-afde-4132-8818-a479cf60cc84;"We will take some time to mourn our dead and heal the wounds this land has suffered," Reinald says after a moment of thought.\n\n"With the Purity gone, the keep now falls to my niece. I will reach out to her to discuss it, though I imagine it will be some time before she comes home.\n\nOtherwise, as always, there are other fights for the Westguard to take up. The Highmark must be protected."
#Stormwatch Faste.18aa4b6c-67cf-49d2-a6d3-6dadbd064828;Very well. Then let us get on.

#Uram Gor Rockslide 2.b27c7ef1-a76b-4834-8e52-b8b704cbebdb;Forced from the cave by the beetles’ advance, you watch helplessly as your soldiers are either torn to pieces by bugs or burned alive by lava.
#Uram Gor Rockslide 2.4d3dad63-aa5a-4a0a-b0a3-b4669c6e1954;You direct your company towards a steep incline, hoping to lead them out of this hell. Unfortunately, the last ones in the line are still struck by yet another licking tongue of liquid flame.

Buried under one of the large constructs they find a small chest, no larger than a pumpkin. It is reinforced with steel and heavy. The lid opens with a quiet creak and finally your hands close around it - a soulstone. 
#Philo Soulstone.7a0ab6f3-f83a-4817-b141-b090ba0d114a;You have gathered all information you could about the soulstones. They are being transported back and forth between the different camps. Being of great value and rarity, they are never without guards. \n\nYou were able to intercept their current traveling party. A group of humanoids and large, metallic constructs that walk besides them. Both of them look menacing and dangerous.

The boy shakes uncontrollably as the demon takes hold of his body.\n\n"What is with the hold up, mage? Have you got cold feet? I have waited long enough.

It is encircled by the clouds of winter and the scorched earth of the desert. \n\nA sense of foreboding emanates from it.
#Ianna Introduction.56439551-d2f6-4664-b556-ad691722329d;The group you spotted bears a banner of one of the Circle Mages. \n\nIt is adorned with the image of great white harp, played by a female bard, who seems to be formed of a multitude of people of all genders. At her feet dancing people, both living and dead, on a mountain of bones.\n\nShadowy figures seem to move in the folds of the banner as if dancing around it.
#Ianna Introduction.cfa37a27-c011-4524-ae11-acc33f264eb6;Certainly an intricate design.
#Isgrimm Introduction.b0a0e509-22d6-4c10-be6a-c5bc986d5424;The group of dwarves you see in the distance carries the banner of one of the mages of the Circle, depicting an anvil inside of which a world of forests, mountains and rivers has been embroidered. It is surrounded by a wreath of fire that seems to move with the banner flying in the wind.

#Raith Introduction.8408ad7a-844c-4592-bd1e-c82cb8beb825;An intense cold seems to emit from the undead soldiers before you. The quiet chime of bones, the occasional groan all reinforces the impression of some dark brooding under the surface.\n\nThey fly the banner of a member of the Circle. It shows a black obsidian gate- an obelisk that is a gateway to a strange world with four moons of different sizes. Looking at it is strangely disconcerting.
#Raith Introduction.de80c5a5-aec8-412f-b441-ead0f8cd66f1;Approach carefully.

This continues until the eye can no longer follow and the figures move with every flap of the banner in the wind. It has a mesmerizing effect.
#Undergast Introduction.087e53cc-8f29-49b6-a3b6-25ad4ba60d80;Interesting design.
#Uram Introduction.8d61b6a1-c7ad-4673-accb-c360a2e535b1;The monstrous group before you carries a strange banner, looking like a stream of flame that entwines and consumes itself, neither beginning nor end discernible. The flowing banner makes it seem as if the flames are actually moving.

He draws the blade along his forearm to continue the glyph. Only a couple of details later, it is done.\n\nWith a rumble and a roar, the ground opens up and creatures clamber forth. Lesser demons! The man lets his arms fall. Even from afar you can see he is exhausted. And when the portal closes, he curses.

Hokan’s undead are sure to have increased unrest for the locals – the trolls and demons of Regan Gor.
#Regan Gor Soulforge.b6b82789-ab5d-447a-a6a4-fa3ac684fc32;Demons swarm the forge’s entrance, pushing back as many opponents as they can. Slashing and biting at with horrifying grins and many an insult, they insulate your company from much of the enemy force.

#Uram Gor City 3_2.6139b07d-a302-41a2-9195-e6018f719c91;I shall return with a recompense.
#Uram Gor City 3_2.c5c307e1-28fe-4918-92e4-56421119ce0f;It takes considerable patience and convincing, but eventually they come around to the idea.\n\nTheir guild master addresses you: “With the way to the Fireforge now free, we don’t even need to dig around here anymore. We will make far better things there than we can even find here. If you guarantee the demons are gone, we agree to your deal.”
#Uram Gor City 3_2.5685fe5c-3d60-4d2d-bb21-e2e2de4ca440;Then it is settled.
#Uram Gor City 3_2.9da8d40c-2f75-45f7-9c35-82d2a5c7a713;The dwarf snorts derisively.\n\n“That doesn’t even cover a tenth of the cost. But… ugh, the main thing is to get to the Fireforge, I suppose. If the demons are truly gone, we will make a fortune from our crafts there, then this paltry sum won’t matter. Fine. I suppose.”\n\nHe snatches the purse, pocketing it and muttering: “For our troubles.”
#Uram Gor City 3_2.d16a1c4c-f968-4774-b68b-d4c4b46335c6;You are welcome.
#Uram Gor City 3_2.597a76ed-1b16-43d0-8c89-aa97b7027b33;“Then it is time!” The assembled dwarves cheer loudly and begin to pack up their tools to make for the Fireforege.\n\n“You are invited to come and share in its bounty,” they tell you. “After all, it is you we should thank that we are able to access it. You are welcome any time.”

He then leans forward again, resting his chin on his hands.\n\n"But there is something more specific I had in mind as well.

I wish you all the best on your path forward."\n\nWith that she goes to leave, heading back towards the shrine.

"The ship did not sail to Finon Mir, and the filth has been cleaned from Sevenkeeps's streets. We stand in your debt."\n\nThat is it then. You standing with Sevenkeeps has certainly increased...

#Westguard Orcs 02_2.3389142c-12a7-491e-ad9c-154f0b301a98;Prisoners of War
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.21a16e9d-625a-4f2c-924f-bb8c9b077a5f;The camp the orc guerrilla fighters take you to is clearly only a temporary measure: a collection of tents with a hastily erected palisade around it. From where you stand, you see a couple of guards posted at the doors to the camp, but little else.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.299660b8-4ee9-4402-82e5-fc4ea78d254b;Little has changed since your last visit. The soldiers inside must be waiting for new orders or perhaps tending to their own wounded before moving on, as the camp has not yet been dismantled.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.ab7477fc-75cf-4a7b-ad2e-f5f4c047775e;Get closer, carefully. Let's get an idea of their strength.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.1d352f80-e815-47cd-9f65-28ac19da951a;Alright. Move up!
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.c9a9b195-68e6-495e-b732-5d0e9364c563;As you get into position, you just about catch sight of the orc guerrilla fighters moving around the camp, and only because you know what to look for. They have adapted well to this style of warfare.\n\nInside the camp, it seems, is a reasonably sized battalion of soldiers from the Westguard. A direct assault would lead to bloodshed on all sides.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.eea8d1a6-8887-4b4d-bbd4-2b378e16922e;Perhaps I can avoid ruining my reputation here.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.87a04438-183f-4828-ab78-d88ef37da98c;Fall back for now. We must re-approach this.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.0e9b1661-f7c9-4371-8f7b-9b52a0d5c46b;A fog will provide the orcs with cover.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.89ea0e7c-6825-444b-ad19-c344d7da3c8e;Telling your troops to fall back, you raise a fog from the ground that grips the camp in a hazy uncertainty.\n\nA few minutes after it lies thick in the air, you hear the first cries and shouts as the alarm goes up. The orcs must have made their move.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.e33dffeb-81a8-4184-916a-a29add1e285d;Strike at the camp now!
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.b08f11cd-c18d-4e85-b6c9-177c84716271;Let them do their work.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.3f245054-69e6-45e8-9a6f-95406b688a84;You make towards the camp as if simply passing by, wishing to receive an update on how the Westguard's campaign fairs. The commander is friendly and amenable, but worried that things are escalating with the orcs, who are now striking at camps beyond the Misty Coast.\n\nMany of the company join him as you chat, leaving the camp almost empty for the orcs to slip in and free their captured warriors.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.86b4afed-d634-4301-8db9-f2e39a7213d0;This is almost too easy.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.45f31ee6-25fb-4258-ab26-717916031a24;As you leave the camp behind you, the orcs slowly and carefully appear out of the underbrush, bringing the rest of their group behind them. The former prisoners are in rough shape, many sporting serious injuries and sores on their arms and legs from the restraints.\n\n"Thank you for your help, mage," their leader says. He passes you a hastily made bundle. "I know it is not much, but we were able to take this from the camp too - it is yours now, as thanks."
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.81d51501-b9f9-4729-b37b-68c6ed2b5295;The orcs focus first on freeing the prisoners, before those who are able come up behind the fight to cut off any Westguard soldiers that might escape. When all is done, the leader approaches you.\n\n"Many thanks, mage." He gives you a deep bow and salute. "As promised - whatever you can find here is yours. We will return to Orgash for now, to rest and prepare for the next strike."
Westguard Orcs 02_2.cd2d5831-b7c2-479d-b86f-3b248fc58d08;All the best with your cause.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.c5b5cd9a-5738-4f42-a665-161d5ddcdd0f;The Westguard soldiers drive your troops back until they can fight no more. The orcs, to their credit, do what they can to support you once their prisoners are freed, but no amount of ferocity can make up for the greater numbers of their enemy.\n\nIn the end, the orcs are slain alongside your company, leaving a bloody mark on this day in history.
#Westguard Orcs 02_2.51d85954-290d-4fb0-86ce-5f85e7787587;The Westguard will no doubt remember this.

Not without crossing me first."\n\nA wave of battle cries roll through the opposing soldiers. As one, they march forward, directing the larger creature even closer to your tower.

He shouts up. "Is it Ianna’s sorcery you have used to bewitch their minds? It matters not! I will be the one to drive you away once and for all, with or without their help!"\n\nWar cries erupt from the horde, which now closes in on all sides.

"I offered my blessings and guidance – and yet you have raised up this… ‘hero’. This war machine that will kill on your command should you ask it. They and you must be destroyed and if the others cannot see that, then I shall do it myself."

Your heart sinks as he snaps the book shut with a smirk, only for it to vanish and reappear on your desk.\n\n"I see you inherited your master’s dangerous habit of hording knowledge instead of sharing it," he says coyly. "The others may not see it, but you are dangerous. I will make sure your advances stop here."

I know what you would do to us! And I know it is not about how many apprentices or followers you can gather around you. It is whether you know how to put them to good use! Here. Let me show you!"\n\nThe mage raises his arms and the army behind him howls in rage, ready to attack.

#Galtrak Rumors.3d1657d1-a4b8-4665-b159-9875586aca72;A merchant has arrived at your tower. \n\n“I come bearing dire news, master mage.” the merchant says, “A bloodthirsty monster is roaming our lands.” 
#Galtrak Rumors.3715d2c8-afa5-48bb-9734-0938abb9b04a;I think more than one roams the realms, really.
#Galtrak Rumors.e79bdd34-1bd5-4913-a60f-833606923c8e;“True, yet none are as terrifying as the Gutter. A truly gruesome creature. \nSome describe it as a shadow, large as a bear with claws larger than a man’s leg. Once it's shadow has been spotted, the screams of terror are sure to follow. It tears villages asunder, leaving nothing but rivers of blood.” 
#Galtrak Rumors.4a33d1ae-1646-40b7-b074-c0a9d7820bbf;That is alarming. I shall ready my troops.
#Galtrak Rumors.bf910dff-8758-419c-bb12-0c1f43125da6;Relief washes over the merchant’s face. \n\n“I am glad to hear it, master mage. I already feel safer, knowing you are willing to provide protection.” 
#Galtrak Rumors.6ad92af8-92da-4fc1-8d8e-0558655be7d7;That is not what I promi… Nevermind...
#Galtrak Rumors.a33fa4d0-aa95-4d11-bbfb-1955ba767eb3;I am glad to be of service.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.a076e1b7-b7b2-4061-a7ef-fb84b12614b0;The tangy smell of blood hangs heavy in the air, as you enter the village. The guards have not exaggerated – everything is drenched in crimson. It's as though a hurricane of blades swept through, slicing and slashing each inhabitant. \n\nBut the macabre scene only distracts you for a second. A palpable, vibrating energy thrums from the runes etched into the blood and dirt. Magic. 
#Galtrak Sullied Village.02711b27-476f-4189-84fe-8657c2870fb9;This feels astoundingly powerful.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.0ff3bef7-7e00-4bef-9e2c-a60dd9fdcd26;Beautiful, isn’t it? 
#Galtrak Sullied Village.cca171d1-8278-4969-acf7-1d5dfff9e862;You step closer, examining the unknown script. The gathered blood pooling in the sigils gives off a slight glow, beckoning you to touch it.\n\nA weak motion to your left distracts your gaze. Somebody has managed to survive.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.bd28abba-0c46-493b-b89c-85de0b6ccb96;There shall be no survivors.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.3476189f-e378-4f19-b515-a7df509f4869;Don’t be alarmed! I am here to help!
#Galtrak Sullied Village.e3176cb7-7c09-4aa4-af01-08cd36f7b65c;Bring them to me. We need more blood.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.b56e3d82-9026-4be4-be37-df6f45c6cb09;The man gurgles as a blade slices through his vocal cords, and he collapses on the runes. You witness the blood seeping into the grooves, mingling there and taking on the strange glow. The magic stretches its tendrils and grows ever so slightly stronger. 
#Galtrak Sullied Village.29f08690-d70d-4593-a5c9-de2979aab282;This is magnificent.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.d472d99a-1481-468f-8b81-3c6ee2f338cb;Imagine what even more blood would feel like.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.3b969354-98f2-491c-979b-3afdd3cdd902;Leaving the village behind, your thoughts wander back to those glowing sigils. Galtrak has uncovered quite a peculiar way of harnessing magic, and judging by the potency you felt, it is bound to grow far stronger than you expected.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.08970074-11d8-4ea6-b273-cfa540066623;I am curious to see where this’ll go.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.4adafdf7-4cc9-4acc-8fd7-8d46f7e1867d;Inspecting the man, you find him in shock. The recent events have left him speechless and dazed, yet he seems unharmed. The blood on him must be from the other victims. 
#Galtrak Sullied Village.f6169db4-3752-41ea-b042-d9b0b723680a;Remember me?
#Galtrak Sullied Village.34a48a5a-e7ec-4f1e-b784-108c2519217a;Here, build yourself a new life.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.1cd0d12b-bb35-4b8d-aa95-35b1c945bbe5;Let’s leave, there is nothing to be gained here.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.88d52996-a3a9-45ef-947c-96c34fd24f90;The man looks down at the coins in his hand confusedly, then picks a seemingly random direction and wanders off in a haze. His steps are cautious, unsure. Soon he starts running.
#Galtrak Sullied Village.4334b115-16a1-4808-94ac-72ec9c764bc2;I hope he will be well
#Galtrak Sullied Village.2d0740b9-c280-47f7-a9b6-d562edb94b14;A sudden burst of heat flares up and you witness a fireball crashing into the man, burning him to a crisp within seconds. Your eyes find Galtraks. \n\n“What?” He smiles coldly. 
#Galtrak Sullied Village.8529cdcd-8113-42c7-9b69-4552fc815c18;For a moment longer, the man’s eyes are unseeing, but slowly recognition begins to settle in and fear sparks to life. With a shriek, he falls backwards and begins to crawl away, an endless cry on his lips. \n\nGaltrak steps forward and unceremoniously decapitates the man with a swift slash.
#Galtrak Hiring.fac48476-a430-4909-9fae-d1a97b6a1776;Guards from the local militia enter your study, dragging a bloodied and shackled orc behind them. A thick, metal band is clamped around his neck, and they push him forward by two rods affixed to the collar. With a twist, the orc is forced to his knees, emitting a pained grunt. 
#Galtrak Hiring.c403d251-ec8f-486c-a813-ca7d4c8d37d1;What is the meaning of this?
#Galtrak Hiring.34b91493-16ee-488d-aadb-059626be41ba;The orc looks up to you, blood dripping from his lips. He smiles and you can feel something dark stir within him. Something ancient.\n\n“What should be do with him, master mage? This magic he wields, it is disturbing.” 
#Galtrak Hiring.f011d794-af3d-48c2-849f-9c1e1385f35f;Indeed it is. What is your name, orc?
#Galtrak Hiring.1684e4c8-a546-45f2-a829-a9802f8996fa;The orc’s smile does not falter. As the guards roughly push him to his knees, his eyes lock with yours.\n\n“You'll regret this day."\n\nA raspy chuckle is the last thing you hear from the orc, as he is dragged away. 
#Galtrak Hiring.57aec208-333f-4a0a-bc8a-82cc161d0d22;I hope I have done the right thing. 
#Galtrak Hiring.0120628a-94ed-4466-b175-e6e346610dd3;"Galtrak."\n"...or the Gutter," he adds bearing his sharp teeth in mockery. "So my magic has captured your attention? I must confess, I didn't expect your curiosity." 
#Galtrak Hiring.0c352218-54ed-476d-9bcc-693eaa4edf58;Tell me all about your ... gifts.
#Galtrak Hiring.02b98ea3-6c79-4691-87da-20ae303b0e81;You don't look like a mage to me.
#Galtrak Hiring.55774243-c88b-4812-8675-14fd108cc75f;A brow raised at your question, his smile grows wider, spreading his lips just a tad too thin.\n\n"Blood is the very essence of life. It holds the most potent magic I know of. Taking a life is..." he closes his eyes in what looks to be delight before continuing. "Nourishing. It renders the magic within it accessible for a fleeting moment." 
#Galtrak Hiring.5f7af726-85b6-4093-96b1-1e08988a3d8a;Another harsh laugh emanates from Galtrak as you snap your fingers, releasing him from the shackles and metal band. The guards step back with a look of fear and suspicion. You dismiss them with a wave of your hand and they hurry towards the door.\n\n"You won't regret this, mage. Blood magic is far superior. And oh so exquisite."
#Galtrak Hiring.85be6d26-9976-4c45-a13c-6a2bfaf97ec3;I can’t wait to find out more.
#Galtrak Peasants 01.0e09bd3c-3107-44f8-83ed-b8efbae25532;A group of local farmers, hunters, and peasants come to your tower. \n\n"We've had enough. The Gutter, he has evolved in his cruelty and wanton violence. He must be stopped!"
#Galtrak Peasants 01.24818535-670b-4934-8a7d-ce2c8916ef32;And why do you come to me with that?
#Galtrak Peasants 01.0fb7e91e-2370-4c17-a272-a51954244752;The locals look at you in shock. \n\n“He is killing our families and you are idly standing by? Maybe even condoning his actions?” \nAnger begins to emanate from them in waves. \n\n“If you make yourself common with this creature you shall suffer its fate, eventually!” 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.6b8f6462-cd88-4639-b486-6beb9c7f454e;I do not fear a couple of peasants. 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.072babdf-44c8-4651-8d85-1e1f884da84d; I deeply regret your loss. My condolences.
#Galtrak Peasants 01.9ef8f301-9039-46bf-856b-12c66dbfd408;The ragtag group accepts your gift with a somber nod. \n\n“Thank you, master mage. With this coin, we can find hired hands and better prepare for the upcoming fight. We knew we could count on you." 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.a4b57314-3633-473c-a834-d0edd2fff148;Always. 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.a525eb15-36be-4b6f-83f0-b5011f25e8e5;The villagers appear slightly disappointed but nod. \n\n"Thank you nonetheless. Your coins could have helped us in our struggle, but we will not give up the fight against the Gutter.” 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.1a14584b-ce79-44b0-8ab9-d7b28e91123b;Best of luck to you all.
#Galtrak Peasants 01.396b14d6-08e9-40ac-8441-c65483b212a1;“And you think this sorry excuse will ease our pains? We have lost so many loved ones, their blood spilled unnecessarily! And still, you stand by this monster?”
#Galtrak Peasants 01.1e943a19-30b9-4f1b-b732-1bde943daa3b;Maybe this will help you forget your pains? 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.3c3d2026-6a67-41a0-a436-0d2eb0aff99b;He is too valuable to me to let go.
#Galtrak Peasants 01.8efdbc2f-baa9-4a40-a32b-6aa0739910b6;A tense silence hangs in the air. After a moment's consideration, they accept the coins disdainfully. \n"This doesn't change anything, mage. You've lost our support." \nThey storm out of your tower. 
Galtrak Peasants 01.d03a4ddf-28f6-4134-b63d-a19565695ea3;Such an inconvenience. 
#Galtrak Peasants 01.b8c8b80f-5171-468e-9062-2cb2e1d7569f;Taken aback by your words, the commoners exit your tower. \n"This isn't the end of it! We won't sit idly and wait for death to claim us. We'll go down fighting!"
#Galtrak Peasants 02.d7fc91d6-372c-4640-b7a1-5721e5f22840;The loud thundering of hooves draws your attention away from your current studies. An entire army has arrived at your tower. \n\n"We won't bear this any longer! The slaughter must cease! We know you're sheltering the Gutter! Hand him over or face retribution!" 
#Galtrak Peasants 02.6b4f3a0c-cadf-493a-bde6-be8fc5984e97;You think your puny army will be a match for my powers?
#Galtrak Peasants 02.dd1743f3-562e-4a5f-a8fa-54b96e1aeb6a;Then you leave me no choice. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 01.04bade59-cf66-434b-a970-cd9d2f3fdedd;You have received reports that Galtrak has killed a group of merchants, practicing his blood magic on their corpses. Now the orc stands before you, showing not a shred of regret. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 01.4634388e-58cf-4f75-9eb8-5008e1a77efe;You must stop this killing without my permission. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 01.bb65d821-fffb-40ea-8c34-dfa8c91c75e8;“And how am I supposed to refine my magic then? By hoping and praying? No, I need blood, and you know it. Have known it from the moment we met.” His large hands land on your desk as he leans forward. \n\n“If you want control of whom I kill, assign me a target. I need blood, and lots of it. I know I’m close, I can feel it. Each drop makes me stronger.” He leans in further.\n\n“Give me a village. That’s what I need.”
Galtrak Sacrifice 01.b713acb6-a240-4021-bf38-82fd7b6b05dd;Fine, I will find you a village. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 01.a406d99e-bc78-4365-b40b-38cc856dc303;I am not liking this one bit …
#Galtrak Sacrifice 01.633a15ef-b386-4158-87b5-cb2ac59bce02;His lips tip up. “You knew what you signed up for, don’t play coy now. A village or two. That is all I’m asking.” 
#Galtrak Research 01.5de68d90-a46d-4d39-8b62-a0d2027e2fa7;As Galtrak looks over the vessels of blood, his eyes gloss over with something akin to desire. He inhales deeply, savoring the scent, and lets out a satisfied sigh. \n\n"Finally. It's time. Come with me to one of Zarach's sacrificial sites. There, I can complete my spell." 
#Galtrak Research 01.962d46c5-1253-4cf3-b60c-e0c0423dcc4f;Lead the way. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.fbb6ff54-bca7-4477-ba55-9b1207687e65;You watch as Galtrak smears the altar with the blood, tracing runes in a trance that transcends mere concentration. Soon enough, the symbols start to glow from within, and a thrumming fills the air. The invisible threads of magic weave through Galtrak and yourself, and you can sense a surge of power. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.b6853ec4-a97f-4efc-9e99-31031fdaf11c;This is magnificent! 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.55a41d8f-1afa-44b6-8b31-00b3789c91f8;He moves closer, almost shaking with anticipation.\n"I can feel that there is so much more power to pull from the blood. If we can collect more, I can increase our power, our magic. No turning back now, my friend.” 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.0dbbaec0-60fe-4a58-9aae-35a66675d8b4;As if the magic was reaching a crescendo, the thrumming in your ears peaks before vanishing altogether. Galtrak turns towards you. A shadow the color of dark blood has shrouded his eyes and now recedes slowly. \n\n"Yes. Yeeees!" he triumphs. "It's worked! I can feel it." He raises his bloodied hands toward the sky and laughs maniacally. \n"Oh, just imagine what more we could accomplish! More! We need more!" 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.0fdfd029-4ebf-4911-856b-b99658112f9b;You mean even more blood?
#Galtrak Sacrifice 02.0375d739-1ab7-49e5-855e-c3af0d755b23;I can't wait to see what else this magic beholds.
Galtrak Sacrifice 02.2a0f0ec6-a4b5-41eb-b0ff-b3e0fc8e24ee;Blood Sacrifice
#Galtrak Research 02.7bafa27d-bb4c-4fac-bc81-398d522bbfc9;Galtrak approaches you, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "I have a few new theories to test. With the blood we've collected, at least one of them is bound to work. Come with me, friend, and let's discover the true potency of my latest spell." \n\nHe produces a brown-flecked leather map, and you notice he's marked another shrine on it. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 03.00cdb91e-ea28-4eed-a30c-57190c198d9f;As Galtrak sets up at the shrine, clouds slowly start to crawl over the sky. With deft fingers, the orc begins to paint sigils, muttering under his breath in a singsong voice. \n\nThe more blood he spreads, the darker the sky grows. This time, the symbols don't stop at the edge of the stone slab that serves as a table. The lines extend on to his own body, tracing softly glowing sigils all over his bare skin. \n\nA deep, rolling thunder echoes through the lands as Galtrak places the last lines across his face. \n\nThe vibrant red seeps into his body, his eyes glowing in the same hue. Galtrak begins to hover above the ground, humming with power. 
#Galtrak Sacrifice 03.0c965aed-7e70-4df3-a2ee-6ba3105c4398;How utterly fascinating.

He begins to chant something you cannot understand, tracing more delicate symbols along his arms and chest. \n\nThe wind picks up, carrying the gut wrenching smell of all the blood over to you and your troops. You hear someone dry heaving from the odor. It is pungent. A sudden frenzy erupts among your troops. Some collapse to the ground shaking with fits, while others draw blades across their own skin, beckoning forth the shining, red liquid.

Relishing the sensation, he closes his eyes and extends his arms as if to embrace the entire world.\n\n"I must confess, I didn't think you were strong enough to endure. I have underestimated you, my brother in blood. I'll stand by your side. You've more than earned my trust and sword."

#Shaper Ruin 01.7542b0f8-cb49-42a8-9a87-d91601efb956;You press at the cover and with a soft click, a hidden door hisses open. Just as you assumed, you find yourself face to face with a horde of angry demons.
#Shaper Ruin 07.35dd57af-d8ce-43e0-8e54-cda78d836553;I can sense a demonic presence. Move carefully.
#Shaper Ruin 07.4597130a-1ea5-4bd8-ab5d-bd4991b51312;You warn your troops as the ground begins to buckle underneath you finally breaking open and releasing a group of the demonic creatures. You have prevented your troops from falling prey to an ambush, so they now fight on more equal terms.
#Shaper Ruin 07.edfbe151-d5c9-4b48-ae1f-c5c5f5e5e054;Hah, this will be easy.
#GRASS_Camp_Human_Ambush.594b4021-fa9d-4d26-a00c-f33d71f66de5;You better run or I'll get real angry.
#GRASS_Camp_Human_Ambush.e41b9237-c5e5-4d08-82cd-e1e162c28e0a;Your eyes turn a demonic black and the thieves look mortified. They have obviously underestimated their prey. \n\nWithout so much as a supressed scream, they turn and run the other direction, leaving you standing before the now abandoned camp.
#GRASS_Camp_Human_Ambush.073c842f-9bbd-47f0-acfd-e2caa2c9702c;Let's have a look at their things.
#GRASS_Camp_Human_Ambush.557004b7-a229-48e7-b761-aa040a575681;Rifling through their belongings brings a letter to the light of day. It has no seal and seems to be the only thing of potential value.

#Highmark Adventure 2.42b90718-7ec4-4d8c-add5-725c1c65fda1;Give them a little demon as a pet.
#Highmark Adventure 2.61790921-3a76-4eab-ab43-4aad41b8e8bc;You produce a little imp to entertain the guests. It promptly jumps on the bridemother's back and begins pulling her hair, then bites the maid of honor's nose with a cackling glee. At the sight of the creatures, the guests panic - some trying to catch it, others fleeing.\n\nWithin moments, the whole affair descends into utter chaos and the devastated bride screams "This is all your fault, " between sobs. "You and your creature are not welcome here! Leave!"
#Highmark Adventure 2.3a1dead5-70a5-4571-b869-abfd8027159f;They obviously don't appreciate a little joke.

#Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3_1.bdde1b8f-2444-4e4a-9658-ed626cfbcdc0;Then I will have a word with those demons.
#Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3_1.90cf29fe-0df8-4063-9466-683c3dde3623;You prowl forward, not even trying to hide your approach. Immediately, you find yourself surrounded by guards and demons, all eager to end your life.
#Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3_1.1a696ac6-abaf-4d6d-8585-b17b6718a6b7;Have you truly sunken so low as to serve these weaklings?
Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3_1.8a265c9f-83f7-4968-b0cd-c93d33cb7416;The humanoid guards exchange frightened looks while the demons regard you with growing interest before turning toward them. A shiver runs through the guards before the first drops his weapon and runs. Spurred on by this, a fight breaks loose, demons against humans. It is a bloodbath from which the infernal creatures emerge as the winners. Satiated with the fight, they leave.\n\nIt seems they were not quite convinced by whatever Uram has promised them in return for their service.
Hokan Rep 2 Adventure 3_1.4cd9f6d4-6845-4957-a16f-a0a2ead94606;Hokan will be pleased.

#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.d64e0599-d0d9-4a8a-b342-4e162ed511dc;That reeks of demonic possession.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.5cf51903-2f28-4ea9-b888-e8eb18740f78;The longer you observe the strange behavior, the more obvious it becomes: those soldiers are possessed by something. You let your magic pierce the mind of one of them and find the gnawing hunger of an insect within.

The soldier breaks down and begins to shake violently as the animal burrows deeper into the head of the screaming man.\n\nThen your magic finally finds purchase. With a firm tug, you rip the worm-like entity out. With a splattering of blood, it lands on the ground, writhing and seeking a new host.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.ba285d53-64b1-4aae-bc69-6197092fde51;You are coming home with me.
#Goldenfields_TraitorArmy.9e4b294f-d802-4606-8a4c-90ff824605d3;We better follow them.

#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.5d3a9650-1e41-4a18-b55e-0ac35553998d;The black stone of the spire radiates heat and darkness. Sulfur and acid burn in the throats and eyes of your troops. A deep growl, like thunder, permeates the area around it.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.170b133b-66e0-4176-a601-9f813aea5bd4;"Then run along, little one. And hurry up, for my patience is wearing thin." The demon's tone is more than a threat. It is a deadly promise.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.53a06849-7a74-461c-aa33-b49095f51b8c;"It has come to my attention that you have run foul of Uram. So I want to offer you a deal." \nA throne of bones appears behind the demon, and he takes his seat, his eyes never leaving yours.\n\n"Make a pact with me to destroy Uram. I will make sure he is weakened and you can deal the final blow. That will serve you well in impressing the Circle and I will be able to leave this stinking place."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.a64a1020-e32c-4805-ba6c-e7808f8cc7ed;"You can call me Azra'Zil, mage. I merely wanted to see the one responsible for destroying Uram." A toothy grin contorts his face terrifyingly. "And might I say, you are much smaller than I anticipated."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.bf0e0e89-ff80-47f6-b606-9535412599ea;A red cloud of smoke begins to gather before you. You almost fear that the demon will rise again, when instead Uram the Red steps from the fog.\n\n"I congratulate you on besting this nuisance." His left arm stretches out, palm up. \n"The demon held something that I want. A weapon. I presume you collected it?"
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.caa3d484-b07b-4e0b-824b-284ac67b2c41;A cackle reaches your ears. It comes closer until a shape takes form in front of you. Claws, shimmering skin and dangerous, glistening eyes - soon you stand before a large and terrifying demon.\n\n"Step closer, mage. Let me get a better look at you. Yes. Yes, you will do just fine."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.55d9f99f-7ab2-4207-b03f-c4cfa23f673e;"You, little one, will help me destroy Uram."\nA throne of bones appears behind the demon, and he sits on it, his eyes never leaving your face.\n\n"Make a pact with me to destroy Uram. I will make sure he is weakened and you can deal the final blow. That will serve you well in impressing the Circle and I will be able to leave this stinking place."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.64bfca1e-a931-4c23-9579-f50098ec0d3f;You suddenly feel a burning sensation in your palm. You look down and find it bleeding. When your eyes come up again, you see your blood on Azra'Zil's claws. He burrows the bloodied claw deep within his own palm.\n\n"Now we are bound by blood. Never forget that, mage. I am unable to harm you and you me. And we must uphold our bargain. No matter the cost."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.c0525c90-c7ad-44c9-8dbb-e5bbff1b7dde;The demon's voice holds a tinge of amusement. "Of course. Do think about it. But don't let me wait too long, mage. Remember, you are not the only one I could strike a pact with. And I am very generous with my rewards."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.1376e90a-eb26-49a9-8f0e-0dd49b1d459d;You hear the demon, before you see him. "Back again, mage? I do not believe you are done yet."\nHe moves with the fluidity of a predator, as he steps out from the darkness that seems to be ever present around his spire. \n\n"Remember, we had a deal in blood. Betray me, and the magic of it will wreck your body before you expire."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.ba3b062a-2a65-46ef-aa25-1c51a93c9e40;I am not done. 
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.80019d60-c032-42a9-8cd6-fa4056959e19;The familiar sight of the dark spire sends a slight shiver down your spine. You can almost see blood dripping from its outer walls and hear screams of terror echoing from within. \n\nSuddenly, the sky darkens, and a familiar voice drones: "You dare to come back? After your tragic last attempt to kill me?"
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.fc63f7b2-b7ca-4bbf-bfb3-9606a0bdb799;You sense a kind of static energy in the air. A buzzing and humming that grows with each step closer to the spire.\n\n"So it is done. I can feel it in the magic that binds us." The demon appears before you, satisfaction visible in his face.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.aca0fe65-874e-47e1-9c47-f5ba5b552402;I destroyed Uram, as we agreed.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.9596ce84-7979-4cf8-994a-c3a88572b38c;With a cloud of dust and sulfur, the demon appears before you. "Welcome back, mage. Did you think about my offer? Have you come back to finally accept it?"
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.e57762df-4e80-4f8e-99e6-48f61a62a677;The demon rips through your ranks within moments, leaving nothing but blood and bones. "You thought you could defeat me? Ha! You better run along now, little one, before I drink your own blood out of your skull." 
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.1f9cbac6-ba69-4bb1-9ad9-97cd066503fe;The demon's eyes widen in disbelieve as you strike it down. For a moment, you see a sinister smile that makes you shiver, but the moment is gone as quickly as it came. \n\nThe large body hits the ground hard and smell of sulfur and rot spreads rapidly all around. A weapon, heavy and gruesome-looking, clatters over the floor with the fall of Azra'Zil.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.704de6a7-8623-4701-b8d0-2cd8657b0328;Uram seems to hold his breath in anticipation, as his fingers take hold of the demonic weapon. "Ah, finally. I thank you, mage. I can see a worthy future asset to our Circle in you." With that, Uram vanishes again.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.cc3657e1-1559-4502-9047-a4688458f536;"A shame." Uram's eyes pierce you, cold and calculating. He vanishes from sight again, leaving you alone with the stench of death.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.87ac372a-b3af-4128-86d2-2652e1a404ec;What are your dealings with Uram?
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.f4a1f3fd-e1c8-4afc-8469-b950a345c771;What in the Guardians' names is this place?
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.56de5b52-9f98-4b92-bb0e-a5d42e80b27b;What are you talking about?
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.e921ca50-2a4e-495f-8d30-5332d086d5e9;Azra'Zil barks a laugh. "The fool has tried to tether me to this plane. Me, a demonic lord! Ha!" He looks down on you. "But you, little one, have helped me a great deal by getting rid of him."\n\nAll of a sudden, the demons face sombers up. "But now you have to leave. I have other matters on my hands, that require my attention. Fare well, little mageling."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.9aa088d8-5111-4f6b-849b-5ea08f808933;The static lifts and you can feel a heavy weight falling off your shoulders. You had not realized how much the deal with this demon has weighed you down until now.\n\n"A deal fulfilled, a promise kept. I will leave this place. Enjoy your time, mage."\n\nAnd just like that the demon and his spire vanishes before you.\n
Demonlord_Uram_HQ.058c4a0c-ac63-46bf-8bb7-e35dbbaab33d;What was the deal again?
Demonlord_Uram_HQ.f581f4e3-7b29-4839-a14e-59f814a9246f;Anger wafts towards you. The demon is slowly losing patience. "I weaken Uram, you destroy him and I, in return, will leave this place." \n\nHe leans forward ever so slighty. "Are we understood, mage?"
Demonlord_Uram_HQ.ed916c25-4d54-4d01-b0d7-0e6ce183c7e9;Right, I remember now.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.d8553327-b401-4e57-bd71-87ebbaa4c2e0;"Don't let me wait too long. My patience only stretches to far."
Demonlord_Uram_HQ.18fc846f-571b-4145-afd6-2bc710829183;I accept.
Demonlord_Uram_HQ.1f0d967e-1b5e-4b13-8081-13369dbdc85d;I need to think about this some more.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.f8bd09f2-7bba-4d1b-ae1b-7518867959f5;I will make sure to keep that in mind.

Demonlords_Introduction_Dream1.025abfd4-dc8b-42ea-b970-50cb990422de;You struggle against the pull for a moment, but to no avail. Slowly, a red mist begins to form under your feet, drawing your attention downwards to where you are plummeting.

Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.a82ca4cd-9bc4-4ec2-9854-9be6d83a5c96;As you move closer, dark spires jut from the ground. The number seems to vary each time you try to focus on them. A path of black gravel appears before you. You carefully follow it, until you reach a fork in the road.\n\nThe left way leads towards a spire shrouded in darkness, while the right ends at a pool of bright, red liquid.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.54b532b6-0a79-4d3a-9b45-c1733eb180fc;Lift your head and look at it.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.004b0164-7269-422c-bc00-7b0b63879d6c;I'll go towards the pool.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.2e5dedbf-71b3-4139-8d0e-1034ba3bbb32;The spire seems to grow in height with every step. As you come closer, you also begin to hear a voice, almost inaudible at the beginning, but gaining volume with your approach.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.2ee848cb-843d-42ec-a8a0-e2f2fb7ccc73;I'll make a sprint towards the spire.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.a12cc013-6bf1-4dea-bd4b-cb4911c03863;A smell penetrates your nose, the closer you come to the pool. Something metallic and tangy. Blood. As you look towards the red liquid, it begins to ripple, as if something were to break the surface soon.
Demonlords_Introduction_Dream2.7c42f51e-4d73-45a1-a7a5-6a4eda921425;Hello? Show yourself at once!

#Demonlord_Uram_Trigger.e17e3e4a-6478-44e4-ac55-1d6c9b94c0ea;The ground shifts and shudders underneath your feet. A large eruption seems to take place quite some distance away. 
#Demonlord_Uram_Trigger.9281e818-c4bf-43f7-a4f8-1414056ed63c;What was that?
#Demonlord_City_Demon_Lost.c5a5c283-b979-479c-8ee9-827b3215d78c;"You promised me might," his voice hisses dripping with venom. "Instead you lose my most powerful weapon and destroy my work! Do you truly believe you can do so and not suffer the consequences? You will rue treachery for a very long and painful time." \n\nThe demon's angry voice reverberates through your body and you awake drenched in cold sweat.
#Demonlord_City_Demon_Lost.20a81ad0-09a4-4eb1-96bd-58f58cebfd20;This will be a problem...
#Demonlord_City_Destroy.28f344d0-d164-4e41-b427-bc4969c4550a;The sun reflects on tiny puddles inside the lush, golden fields of wheat surrounding the city. Swaying grass and serene meadows as far as the eye can see. It is such a peaceful day, you could almost forget what you are about to do to this place.
#Demonlord_City_Destroy.0d3f5db5-3732-400a-b6b2-a9ba74527f6f;The golden fields are soon drenched in the blood and innards of the innocent. Their screams of terror echo over the land and you watch as the once bustling city is utterly annihilated. \n\nSomewhere you can make out the flapping of wings, announcing Mrask Dur's arrival.
#Demonlord_City_HQ.1bf8c8ab-00cf-4827-94b1-de838c45ce30;The demon's abode seems to claw at the sky itself, with long, sharp spires of obsidian. Veins of a crimson run through the dark walls, pulsating with an ominous rhythm, as if alive. The air around the spire feels unnaturally dense and the surrounding countryside looks like it had every ounce of power and live drained from it.
#Demonlord_City_Destroy.7024cf19-2a4e-43e8-8c25-6aaae0f6e735;"So I can see," the demon snarls. He waits patiently beside you, until the last scream falters. Then he continues: "Yes, I am satisfied. You did uphold your end of the pact, so I shall uphold mine. You have proven a reliable partner, mage."\n\nA great sense of relief washes over you as you see the large creature turn and leave. But today's slaughter will haunt your thoughts.
#Demonlord_City_Destroy.1dabd3c0-67e7-4c88-9219-5ad9dfe563a0;You turn your back on the city and as you set a foot outside, sharp pain rips through your body, like a hot knife slicing through your every nerve. "How dare you break our contract! You are bound to it wIth your own blood!" The demon's furious voice inside your head adds a whole new level of pain.\n\n"You leave me no choice but to punish your disobedience, mage. You will regret this day until the last breath you draw." The voice vanishes again, but the pain remains.
#Demonlord_City_Destroy.f005d5e3-52fe-4d2a-86b7-6bc267c17dff;I must destroy this demon before he destroys me.
#Demonlord_City_Introduction.6f0a61d8-d681-43fd-933b-6d79150cee97;The sound of heavy wings above your troops alarms you. Expecting to see a wyvern or griffon, you scan the sky and spot a large demonic creature with leathery wings. \n\nDespite its large frame, the creature is quite fast and soon vanishes behind a dark spire in the distance.
#Demonlord_City_Introduction.f0a78000-37da-44c7-9738-4d82bff2511b;How curious.
#Demonlord_City_HQ.9a85a108-7ab9-4506-a592-4063d3665994;The flapping of heavy wings draws your eyes upwards and you watch as a giant pale-skinned demon descends from the sky. \n\n"If it isn't the mage, I've heard so much about." You can feel the demon's mocking voice in your belly.\n"Come, let me have a look at you."
#Demonlord_City_HQ.ded9106e-4809-4235-b40a-cecc1227e98f;Who are you?
#Demonlord_City_HQ.21e9c1df-cd81-47ac-926d-fde46a04d7ea;One of his long-fingered claws opens and you can see something in it, pulsating and twitching. "This, my curious mage, is a powerful demon in the making. I want you to take this demon spirit and use it in your battles until it has absorbed all it can." \n\nHe leans closer, the smell of sulfur lingering on his skin and offers his other hand to you.
#Demonlord_City_HQ.51a7a5a9-8172-4b5c-ac6b-e03e80ddd73b;"Fine, I can be patient." The demons grin turns wicked. "But not for long, mage."

#Demonlord_City_HQ.724e472a-3c77-4108-b410-7e30c7255bb1;The heavy flapping of wings is omnipresent around the spire. Then you hear the voice and a nauseating feeling spreads in your stomach. "You dare challenge me again, mage? A futile endeavor."
#Demonlord_City_HQ.9a80b4f8-6b62-4c0a-8c68-80bfe5f5a291;"You have returned already? I doubt you are already done." The demon lord regards curiously.
#Demonlord_City_HQ.0acd37fa-ec34-4ae5-adeb-740ff5bca7c2;Mrask Dur rolls his eyes let's out a sigh. "I knew working with your kind would be exhausting... Now listen well, mageling: I've entrusted you with my demon spirit weapon. Have it grow to its fullest then return and prove its might to me," he says condescendingly. "Do you think you will manage to remember this?"
#Demonlord_City_HQ.06c6ede7-8455-441f-ba11-38dea1fc4fec;"I am Mrask Dur, the new lord over this part of Fiara. My minions have told me of your potential and while I can see what they mean, you seem to have cast your lot with the Circle already. I have no use for someone who cowers to these upstarts."\n\nDisinterested, the demon turns. "Go, mage. I don't need you interfering with my plans."

Demonlord_City_HQ.f3e7a374-c7b6-4b02-b7a9-d00adc2ff3fe;You return to the spire, but you have already fulfilled your part in the demon's pact. There is nothing more to gain here.
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.7918300e-7e98-4a3d-b486-921e18b678d9;"I am one of the demonic lords. Your tongue can probably not pronounce my true name, but you can call me Azra'Zil." The demon straightens and his chin lifts slightly.\n\n"I am here because the imbecile Uram has tried to tether me to this plane." Azra'Zils face turns dark and and a sinister grin spreads his thin lips. "And so I want to teach this daring fool a lesson."
#Demonlord_Uram_HQ.a5524fc7-ab89-4136-8921-a494104759ea;What do I have to do with this?
#Demonlord_City_HQ.f71d0af2-62b1-4b17-b97a-b8076080efdc;Impatience begins to show in the demon's features. "You take my weapon, fight with it until it has reached its full potential and prove to me its power. In return, I will help you fulfill the Circle mage's menial task. We seal it with blood, no one can hurt the other, yada yada. Deal?"
#Demonlord_City_HQ.97923f54-96d2-494b-a5e8-bf6e602951aa;"The deal is for you to prove the power of my weapon by destroying a city. Now hurry along, I have other things to attend to." The demon lord has started pacing inpatiently and you can hear him whisper something under his breath. It sounds very much like a threat to your life, if you do not hurry.

#Demonlord_Uram_Trigger.d9745742-cc48-442c-8caf-4dbf2c1239c9;You begin to scry for the origin of the quake. Your magic manifests like it has before, showing you what has happened in a display of spectral figures and shapes.\n\nYou see Uram the Red, one of the mages of the Circle, who is in the process of performing a complex ritual. But due to whatever reason, the ritual goes awry. A portal bursts open and for a split second you feel the eyes of a mighty creature on you.
#Demonlord_Uram_Trigger.545f39db-5ba1-4d64-943a-71cb7b224b1a;This presence, it is immensly powerful.

#Demonlord_Uram_Trigger.5982d13e-f39a-4e0d-a3ff-4c54a918ded3;I should investigate this.
#Demonlord_Army_Spotted.346cde3d-9a01-455b-8590-480aa3a9a51c;A tall and twisted spire, built on a foundation of corpses, rises before you. You see lesser demons whipping rows of humanoids into submission, all carrying enormous amounts of food and drink into the spire from steaming kitchens around it.\n\nIt must be the stronghold of a powerful demon lord, for you also spot hundreds of armed creatures of all kinds parading around. A deep red sun barely breaks through the dark clouds surrounding the place.
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.57a7a45f-9e6b-4b65-9ab1-88ce901e18b1;A clammy hand, slick with blood, rises before you and you look down to see a very battered goblin. One of the wretched creature's ears is missing and half his face is almost completely burnt from standing too close to one of the large cooking fires.\n\n"You want to meet master Krahz Al'Guh, you pay tribute."
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.99275a19-e4a1-4365-8309-4274d69b5373;The smell of burnt meat and the sizzling of multiple cooking fires is the first thing you notice when you finally reach the spire. Slaves, humanoid and otherwise, work large contraptions to grill massive amounts of meats. Many of them sport burns and scars on their skin.\n\nAs you arrive, more workers appear as well, coming closer from various directions, transporting additional resources and provisions. 
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.35c3c62e-02be-45b9-ae9e-583bccc591f8;This almost looks like a war camp.

"You... dare... ?" \n\nHe collapses without another word and the putrid smell of feces and sweat hangs heavily in the air.\n\nHis weapon, half burried underneath his formless body, glints in the last light of day.

Soon, the large double doors of the spire open and he waves you to follow.\n\nInside, you finally behold the master of this spire - a massive demon with curving horns and flaps of fat bulging out across his form. He is currently too engrossed in devouring a whole cow to pay you much attention.\n\nThe goblin bows to him and anxiously gestures for you to do the same.
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.8d3b1942-e0ab-4e15-8659-5630d79a23ac;Stand and wait.

#Demonlord_Army_HQ.9ffb9459-5c68-49b5-afcf-c92799c3d185;For the first time, the demon looks up from its meal. "Ah, the Circles latest toy. Unfortunately, I have no deal to offer you, mage. You have nothing of interest to me."\n\nHe continues his feast and you notice the goblin besides you inching away.

#Demonlord_Army_HQ.8df29ad4-9c55-4d35-b9d7-4035ebfdddc4;A chuckle makes his enormous belly jump up and down. The goblin, still standing besides you, eyes his master nervously then cackles along, trying not to draw attention to himself.\n\n"You have spunk, mage. I like that." He carelessly flicks away the carcass, nearly obliterating the ducking goblin with, then leans forward. His putid breath reeks of sweat and rot. "I think I may have a deal for you. One that benefits us both equally."

I will send some of my followers with you. They know how to ensnare a creature and bind it. Now, stretch out your hand."\n\nYou do as you are told and the demon rams his fat-encrusted fingernail into your palm. You wince in pain and revulsion. Krahz Al'Guh bites down on his tongue and spits blood on your hand. "It is done. Now we are bound by blood. Remember to uphold your end of the deal. You don't want to suffer the consequences of breaking the pact."
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.db63080d-2f7c-4831-a1a2-37eae30eb997;We are agreed. I will return with the slaves you asked for.
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.6254a688-bf8d-4ca7-8ed7-97613d2e4c15;Krahz Al'Guhs face scrunches up in disappointment. "You make me wait at your peril. Be gone!"\n\nOrcs carrying a large platter of steaming meat approach the demon and he eagerly skewers a few pieces with his claw, including one of the empty eyed orcs and greedily swallows them. It seems he has all but forgotten about you already.
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.21d4dfd3-037e-437e-943a-21493e20daed;"You back! Come see master?" The disfigured goblin with the missing ear greets you eagerly.

Demonlord_Army_HQ.86a69cf5-20e8-490f-9f11-4107cbebad96;You have already fulfilled your end of the bargain. And you spot some of your former slaves amongst the demon's servants. \n\nThere is no more deals to be made here.
#Demonlord_Army_HQ.634f2352-decb-4721-ac6e-2027fd02c751;You are greeted by the familiar face of the burnt goblin. "Master needs slaves, two times five or many. You no bring, you no enter." He takes up a defensive stance, as if he alone could hold off you and your troops.

"Bring me what I require and I will erect a statue, nay, a landmark to carry your fame beyond the bounds of the Highmark!"

Your likeness, cast in glimmering gold towers above you.\n"Are you satisfied, oh humble mage," the demons asks mockingly.
#Demonlord_Army_Invest.d883c7c0-d105-476b-9cd9-fcbb23c979e3;It is certainly...impressive.

#Demonlord_Apprentice_HQ.1b0021bd-09d7-42d9-a184-e70ab3d66803;What a dreadful place.
#Demonlord_Apprentice_HQ.0d4d3b0c-ba35-40ed-8770-92c46df91cbd;"That is because you are not welcome here."

Its faceless head and powerful built could send a lesser person into a fearful fit. 
#Demonlord_Apprentice_HQ.255fae4f-12a9-47a2-a9be-2ca55095d6d3;So you finally show yourself to me.

I find their talent and power promising. It is amusing to see how your creature struggles. No matter, within a few days it will succumb to me."\n\nSuddenly, your apprentice sinks down, crying out in pain. You see a dark mark appearing on the apprentice's forehead as if burned into the skin.

The fields hold less crops, ores crumble to dust, wildlife has abandoned the place. Nothing that holds even just a spark of life wants to linger.

Interested?"
#Morgak_Hiring.19c7ad21-0877-48fa-bbd0-f6ae5d39c753;Trade what exactly?
#Morgak_Hiring.05d5d048-4523-4b23-a3e8-c1387822c567;"Look past their demeanor, they have been made...pliable. Look, for instance, my two-headed dire wolf.

#Morgak_Hiring.18267097-c940-45d9-babe-c5414d2ee3e6;The troll does not resist your guards as they lead him towards the tower. On his chest, someone carved a word: 'Morgak'.\n\nBut the troll is docile and you see nothing of the fight in him that the slaver promised. Perhaps he needs a rest and some food - he looks quite malnourished.
#Morgak_Introduction.07ecaa4c-97d6-4321-add4-52df8ce5288b;Having some free time, you decide to check on the troll you recently acquired. You discover him in a dark corner, oblivious to his surroundings. He has not touched the food put before him.

He challenged me to a duel."\n\nYou can see an angry glow slowly appearing in his eyes. "He cheated. Used magic to defeat me. But my tribe did not believe my words." He lets his head hang low again.
#Morgak_Introduction.71f242bb-520d-4425-b3b4-3aa368dbdd47;So you want revenge?

#Morgak_Debuff_Removed.eb5567b3-a7d8-42f1-bec8-b3b51bc2a8dc;He nods. "I feel...more alive than in a long time." \nA darker expression settles on the troll's features as he continues: "I want revenge. I want to kill Gravoc. But," he looks intently at you "I need help."

#Morgak_Armor_Finished.25eb43f8-994e-4078-a2aa-a5e634fd4e1b;Morgak dons his newly forged armor and you prepare the spell to enhance it. The metal plates are crudely assembled and unwieldy, but somehow fit the troll perfectly. \n\nYou cast the incantation and watch as the magic slowly permeates the metal of the armor. Sigils appear all over the armor's surface and Morgak nods approvingly.
#Morgak_Armor_Finished.0375af2c-63ae-4692-8c0c-7dd0ab97ccf8;So, are you going to fight Gravoc now?
#Morgak_Armor_Finished.aacc8a10-d437-4f46-90d9-6f801391d751;The troll nods grimly. "When Gravoc left me to die, he lead my tribe away from our homestead. He wants to roam and plunder. I saw his tracks some nights ago. I will find him and I will kill him."

#Morgak_Populace_Afraid.5361f948-12dd-4967-84ac-9ac5ba9b4f6f;"By the Guardians! It's a troll!" You hear the cry before you see a farmer, loading some hay onto a nearby cart. "Flee, you fools!"\n\nLooking around, you can see none but your own troops.

#Morgak_Populace_Afraid.0060b838-bd33-4565-8d0d-6b052f46de37;You are right! I shall strike him down!
#Morgak_Populace_Afraid.941b6b9d-b9c6-449d-9901-706216d32fbb;You gesture towards Morgak to play along. Murmuring some nonsensical  words and flicking your fingers around, you pretend to throw a spell at the lumbering troll and a few sparks leave your fingertips. \n\nMorgak rolls his eyes before going down at the apropriate time with an unconvincing cry of pain.
#Morgak_Populace_Afraid.f46ee7d6-c27b-4d96-b314-b3b6d5df3408;There, it is done.

#Morgak_Sullied_Village.01729d44-34f8-45fd-be24-d4ec4245176d;Morgak suddenly halts and smells the air. You see his large nose inhale and his brows furrow. "I smell blood. Lots." The eyes of the large troll begin to scan the ground and you follow his gaze, finding the bones at the same time as him.
#Morgak_Sullied_Village.fca6e825-0e2a-4284-abaf-d38ed116779e;Someone was here. Continue carefully.

Morgak turns to you, a growing rage clearly visible on his face. "Gravoc."

#Morgak_Endfight.ef00cd91-b0ee-4e09-a7b7-1fcce684582e;Morgak's face is rigid as you approach the Troll camp. You have been spotted and the news of your arrival leads to much activity among the trolls. \n\nMorgak stares towards the camp and whispers "The armor will hold, right?". His eyes never leave the tents before him as he shrugs. "Ah, what does it matter. Gravoc! Face me, traitor!" he bellows the challenge and his muscles ripple in his neck and arms as he straightens up to full height.
#Morgak_Endfight.65b3c7f0-fa93-412c-9a51-a6c28818018f;Let's see how this plays out.
#Morgak_Endfight.2545758a-4dd9-44e9-a568-4e555dbbfab8;"Are you now?" Gravoc's glance passes over your troops. "Fine. But I will not have them interrupt us. You know, for fairness' sake." \n\nHe begins to weave a spell and you can feel the beginning of a petrification spell take hold of your troops. If you order them to run now, they could still get out. 
#Morgak_Endfight.73950262-a645-4874-903a-c08cb6cac274;Out of breath and sweating, Morgak rips the necklace from Gravoc's body and tears it apart triumphantly. Immediately, you feel the pressure of the troll's magic lift. You can see Gravoc twitching, as death slowly takes hold of him. \n\nWith a triumphant roar, Morgak raises his fist, showing everyone the necklace. "This coward used magic to best me! And for the second time now, he failed! He is not blessed by Mugwa! He is a traitor! And he deserved a traitor's death." \n\nThe surrounding trolls look on, shifting uncomfortably.\n\nYou see some of the other trolls gawk, others retreating in shock or fear. 
#Morgak_Endfight.3da0e2c1-acf4-41f9-9aba-dc0d34cd4c9b;What about the others, Morgak?

#Morgak_Endfight.48ec2ec4-ce79-4cc3-a380-f4eb58e9f50f;Morgak looks around, taking in the sight of the trolls staring at him. "Some of you stood by and chanted Gravoc's name as he used his magic to best me. Others just stood by idly. Very few took my side."\n\nTense murmur begins to erupt within the ranks of the trolls and you can hear voices disapprove of Morgak's win.
#Morgak_Endfight.d7a81ca6-9fac-4dec-8c2c-19fcf79075e7;The trolls share a look of discomfort before hesitantly nodding in agreement. "Morgak. You...you are the rightful chieftain of this clan. We shall follow Morgak."\n\nMorgak gives a gruff nod. "If you follow, I will lead you." The trolls start to pack up and ready themselves to follow their new leader. Morgak gives you a satisfied grin.
#Morgak_Endfight.380c110a-b29d-4a23-af41-8d5ec38e4773;Having beaten you, the trolls will most likely move on and wreak havoc elsewhere.
#Morgak_Endfight.b1b1fe0b-217c-478c-8abd-60aa36918ac2;For a moment, Morgak walks between the tents with a pained expression. Then, as if breathing out his emotions, he let's out a long sigh and comes to stand next to you.\n\n"It is a waste, having to kill them. But they would have never accepted me. They would have remained a threat."
#Morgak_Endfight.86d6a99b-d20b-48a0-8258-0cedb79d32b5;I think you are right. A necessary deed.

"Off of me, woman!"\nThe whole scene begins to draw the attention of a few bystanders.

#Goblin Finale.d4c1cd36-90d6-45b1-aedc-8c6a17c7ba95;You notice that Burgle's twitching has worsened in the last hour. It seems that the closer he gets to the Dreamweaver's home, the more he feels the magical effects of the curse.\n\nAs you arrive in the dead of night he sighs heavily. "I's can't wait to be done with this. Stay close and don't youse touch anything." Murmuring he adds, "Let's get this over with."
#Goblin Finale.e4abfb9d-5113-4f6f-ad96-60eb8f8ac521;Everyone, stay vigilant.
#Goblin Finale.3879ec77-86d9-4283-a90a-a80026367b40;Entering the large vault through a hidden crack, Burgle leads you into a long hallway. "Careful, don't step on-!" Whatever he was about to warn you from was cut short by a magical missile flying past his left ear.\n\n"Bugger! They changed the spell." Examining your troops he asks: " 's any one of youse handy with magic?"

Once the whizzing of passing spells stops, he makes his way forward. \n\nJust on the very last step, he triggers something and icy water drenches you all. "Blasted! We better hurry."
#Goblin Finale.f913ee20-5dcb-434c-b236-4124bc616e32;You focus your mind and carefully pull apart the magic that is spread across the floor like a cobweb. Burgle nods approvingly before leading your troop in deeper. \n\nYou pause for a moment, admiring the intricate web of magic woven here. Someone definitely knew what they were doing. Their tactics fascinate you. Burgle looks back. "We going?"
#Goblin Finale.9e5e0d1b-cfb1-4db8-be08-8725d991688e;Just as you are about to enter another room, Burgle stops and points towards a well hidden door. It is decorated with carvings, showing a mine and dwarves working with pickaxes. On the top dwarven script curves artfully along the frame. He raises an eyebrow at you.
#Goblin Finale.6c62b7ea-45b4-42a2-aa60-8d82693e9cda;'Pride in your work is rewarding.'
#Goblin Finale.b90ad86a-8fb8-47d9-8282-fb5c29838491;No time for that. Let's go.
#Goblin Finale.40d30769-9fc3-49d9-9291-191fb3ea2936;In a flash, Burgle presses on the appropriate carvings - a dwarf, a pickaxe, a crystal-and with a gentle rolling sound, the door slides aside. Behind it lies a treasure trove of shimmering gold, sparkling jewels, and more. The little thief grins and quickly stuffs his pockets. " Already worth it," he chortles.
#Goblin Finale.44a54521-4827-4353-bfc6-eb6b3cc81615;Were as before Bungle has walked these halls carefree, he now moves slowly, cautiously. He leans around corners and peers behind doorways. \n\nAt the last threshold, he waves to everyone to stop and be quiet. With the help of a mirror, he looks around the corner. "Guards," he growls in a low voice.
#Goblin Finale.040b4fdf-6ee7-47eb-b081-129841434b39;Let's hope this won't have consequences.
#Goblin Finale.e74ed8ec-0472-4724-8a22-47f5224cf036;Although Burgle gives his all in the fight, he and the rest of your crew are subdued and defeated within moments.

#Goblin Finale.fb812531-1c9d-4334-93f9-6e35aec7cb03;We better get out of here.
#Goblin Finale.a0f3ef3e-98cf-41e5-b00f-07cb04053dc5;With your opponents slain, Burgle bursts through the final door. He returns with a triumphant shout, Grimoire in hand.\n\n"Do it, please! Youse put an end to my misery!" His watery eyes look pleadingly into yours as he offers you the book.
